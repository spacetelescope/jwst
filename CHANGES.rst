===================

assign_wcs
----------

- Increase margin at edges of NIRSpec MOS slits to reduce edge effects in resampling. [#7976]

associations
------------

- Prevent group candidates from generating level 3 TSO associations. [#7982]

charge_migration
----------------

- Added tests to see if the data array is changed after runnung the step and
  set the default signal_threshold to 25000. [#7895]

extract_1d
----------

- Move MIRI MRS residual fringe correction later in the code after normalization by
  pixel area of each wavelength plane, and apply residual fringe correction to surface
  brightness and background vectors as well as flux. [#7980]

flat_field
----------

- Update the ``combine_fast_slow`` function for NIRSpec spectroscopic flats
  to use 1D error values provided by F-flat reference files. [#7978]

- For NIRSpec modes, set all DO_NOT_USE pixels to NaN after flat
  correction. [#7979]

set_telescope_pointing
----------------------

- Ensure that CRPIX1/2 are set to default values for Guiding modes that fail pointing determination [#7983]

straylight
----------

- Adjust MIRI MRS straylight routine to ensure cross-artifact correction does not
  get applied to pedestal dark signal. [#7980]


1.12.1 (2023-09-26)
===================

extract_1d
----------

- For MIRS MRS IFU data allow the user to set the src_type and allow
  the user to scale the extraction radius between 0.5 to 3.0 FWHM. [#7883]

- Bug fix for #7883. The input model type is checked to see if the input is
  a single model or a model container. [#7965]

assign_wcs
----------

- Use isinstance instead of comparison with a type for lamp_mode inspection [#7801]

- Save bounding box to imaging WCS matching the shape of the data, for datamodels
  without a defined bounding box. [#7809]

- Update the assignment of "source_id" values for NIRSpec fixed-slit exposures, so
  that the slit containing the primary target always has source_id=1 and secondary
  slits use a two-digit source_id value that reflects both the primary target in
  use and the secondary slit from which the data are extracted. [#7879]

- Compute sky position of dithered slit center for MIRI LRS fixed slit data, and
  store in dither metadata under ``dithered_ra`` and ``dithered_dec``. [#7796]

associations
------------

- Update the Level 3 product name construction for NIRCam coronagraphic data that
  get processed through both coron3 and image3, to add the suffix "-image3" to the
  product name for the data processed as imaging, in order to prevent duplicate
  Level 3 file names from each pipeline. [#7826]

- Update the Level 2 spectroscopic ASN rules to exclude any NIRSpec IFU exposures that
  use filter/grating combinations known to produce no data on the NRS2 detector.
  [#7833]

- Remove order dependency on association diffing. [#7853]

- Update the Level 3 association rules for NIRSpec fixed-slit so that observations

  those two slits combined into a single final product. [#7879]

- Update the Level 3 product name construction for NIRSpec fixed-slit observations
  so that both the "source_id" and "slit_name" are left as variables for the
  "calwebb_spec3" to populate at execution time. This update required an update to
  the handling of the "opt_elem" attribute, so that it now only contains filter
  and pupil information, while slit information is contained in the separate
  attribute "fxd_slit". [#7879]

background
----------

- Allow background accumulation for combinations of full and subarray observations [#7827]

calwebb_spec2

-------------

- Updated to create output product names for NIRSpec fixed-slit data based on
  both the "source_id" and "slit_name" values for each set of slit data, so that

- Step was renamed from undersampling_migration. Changed default signal threshold,
  added efficient routine to flag neighborhood pixels, added new unit test,
  improved earlier unit tests, updated docs. [#7825]

  file in the assocation. [#7714]

outlier_detection
-----------------

  save_intermediary_results=True. [#7845]

pathloss
--------

- Fix interpolation error for point source corrections. [#7799]

- Update the MIRI LRS fixed-slit correction to default to the center of the slit
  when the computed target location is outside the slit. Add the parameter

  in STCAL. [#7888]


refpix
------

- Modified algorithm of intermittent bad pixels factor to be the number
  of sigmas away from mean for the corresponding array (either differences,
  means, or standard deviations arrays). [#7745]

resample
--------

- Use the same logic for computing input range for resample step from input
  image shape and the bounding box both for ``SCI`` image as well as for the
  ``ERR`` and ``VARIANCE_*`` images. [#7774]

- Update the following exposure time keywords: XPOSURE (EFFEXPTM),
  DURATION and TELAPSE. [#7793]

---------------

- Use scipy.interpolate.BSpline instead of astropy.modeling.Spline1D in
  residual_fringe fitting utils [#7764]


set_telescope_pointing

  required sphinx-asdf version [#7696]

- Fix minor formatting typos in associations docs. [#7694]

- Add note to ``calwebb_spec2`` step table to clarify the swapped order of ``photom``
  and ``extract_1d`` for NIRISS SOSS data. [#7709]

===================

datamodels
----------

- Added two new header keywords to track the rate of cosmic rays and snowball/showers
  [#7609, spacetelescope/stdatamodels [spacetelescope/stdatamodels#173]

jump
----

- Updated the code to handle the switch to sigma clipping for exposures with
  at least 101 integrations. Three new parameters were added to the jump step to
  control this process.
  Also, updated the code to enter the values for the cosmic ray rate and the
  snowball/shower rate into the FITS header.
  [#7609, spacetelescope/stcal#174]

pixel_replace
-------------

- Fixed bug in setting the step completion status at the end of processing. [#7619]

ramp_fitting
------------

- Updated the CI tests due to change in STCAL, which fixed bug for using the
  correct timing for slope computation.  Since there are now special cases that
  use ZEROFRAME data, as well as ramps that have only good data in the 0th
  group, the timing for these ramps is not group time.  These adjusted times
  are now used. [#7612, spacetelescope/stcal#173]

tweakreg
--------

- Fixed a bug in the ``adjust_wcs`` *script* that was preventing passing
  negative angular arguments in the engineering format. Exposed ``adjust_wcs``
  function's docstring to be used in building ``jwst`` documentation. [#7683]

- Added support for units for angular arguments to both ``adjust_wcs`` script
  and function. [#7683]

  against if analytic inverse does not exist [#7018]

associations
------------

- Updated level-2b and level-3 rules to properly handle NIRCam Coronagraphy
  observations that use all 4 short-wave detectors. Only treat the one detector that
  contains the target as coron, while treating the others as regular imaging. Also
  create an image3 ASN that contains data from all 4 detectors. [#7556]

background
----------

- Mask out NaN pixels in WFSS images before removing outlier values and calculating mean in
  ``robust_mean`` function. [#7587]

blendmeta
---------

- Use ``JwstDataModel`` instead of deprecated ``DataModel`` [#7607]

cube_build
----------

- Remove deleting the ``spaxel_dq`` array twice when using a weighting method of either msm or emsm. [#7586]

- Updated to read wavelength range for NIRSpec IFU cubes from the cubepars reference file,
  instead of setting it based on the data. This makes use of new NIRSpec IFU cubepars reference
  files with wavelength arrays for the drizzle method. [#7559]

datamodels
----------

- Removed use of deprecated ``stdatamodels.jwst.datamodels.DataModel`` class from
  all steps and replaced it with ``stdatamodels.jwst.datamodels.JwstDataModel``. [#7571]

- Dynamically inspect ``stdatamodels.jwst.datamodels`` and expose it as
  ``jwst.datamodels`` [#7605]

  step now comes before the ``flatfield`` step. [#7593]

- Remove references to deprecated ``jwst.datamodels.DataModels`` [#7607]

- Added link to JWST help desk on the top documentation page. [#7610]

extract_1d
----------

- Changed the logic for handling NIRSpec IFU data, so that both point and extended sources
  are treated the same, i.e. assume the inputs are in units of surface brightness for all
  sources and convert extracted values to flux density. [#7569]

- Changed IFU source location to floating point from integer, added ifu_autocen option to
  automatically find point source centroids using DAOStarFinder. [#7594]

- Added ifu_rfcorr option to apply 1d residual fringe correction to extracted
  MIRI MRS spectra. [#7594]

flat_field
----------

- Added log messages for reporting flat reference file(s) used. [#7606]

other

- Added time-dependent correction for MIRI MRS data [#7600, spacetelescope/stdatamodels#166]

pixel_replace
-------------

- Add ``pixel_replace`` step to ``Spec2Pipeline``, which uses a weighted interpolation
  to estimate flux values for pixels flagged as ``DO_NOT_USE``. [#7398]

ramp_fitting
------------

- Updated CI tests due to a change in STCAL, which fixed a bug in the way the number
  of groups in a segment are computed when applying optimal weighting to line
  fit segments. [#7560, spacetelescope/stcal#163]

residual_fringe
---------------

- Updated utilities code to add functions for MIRI MRS residual fringe correction to be applied
  to one-dimensional spectra. [#7594]

refpix
------

- Assign reference pixel flag to first and last four columns for
  NIRSpec subarrays that do not share an edge with full frame,
  so that corrections can be computed from those unilluminated pixels. [#7598]

regtest
-------

- Updated input filenames for NIRCam ``wfss_contam`` tests [#7595]
srctype
-------

- The SRCTYAPT takes precedence over PATTTYPE when setting the source type for
  MIR_LRS-FIXEDSLIT, MIR_LRS-SLITLESS, 'MIR_MRS', NRC_TSGRISM, NRS_FIXEDSLIT, NRS_BRIGHTOBJ, NRS_IFU. [#7583]

tweakreg
--------

- Fixed a bug in the ``tweakreg`` step that resulted in an exception when
  using custom catalogs with ASN file name input. [#7578]

- Added a tool ``transfer_wcs_correction`` to ``jwst.tweakreg.utils`` that
  allows transferring alignment corrections from one file/data model to
  another. It is an analog of the ``tweakback`` task in the
  ``drizzlepac``. [#7573, #7591]

- Added the 'GAIADR3' catalog to the available options for alignment;
  this has been enabled as the default option [#7611].


1.10.2 (2023-04-14)
===================

- pinned `stdatamodels`, `stcal`, and `stpipe` below API-breaking changes [#7555]

===================

documentation
-------------

- Corrected information about the application of the ``srctype`` step to WFSS exposures.
  [#7536]

extract_1d
----------

- Update to be skipped for NIRSpec fixed slit modes with rateints input, because
  that mode is not allowed. [#7516]

flat_field
----------

- Updated to allow processing of NIRSpec fixed-slit 3D (rateints) files. [#7516]

jump
----

- Added a new parameter that limits maximum size of extension of jump. It exists
  in the STCAL jump code but not in JWST. This allows the parameter to be changed.
  Also, scaled two input parameters that are listed as radius to be a factor of two
  higher to match the opencv code that uses diameter. [#7545]

other
-----

- Remove use of deprecated ``pytest-openfiles`` plugin. This has been replaced by
  catching ``ResourceWarning``s. [#7526]

- Remove use of ``codecov`` package. [#7543]

photom
------

- Label spectral data units for NIRISS SOSS as MJy, to be consistent with
  ``PHOTMJ`` scalar conversion factor and other point-source spectral data [#7538]

resample_spec
-------------

- Update ``resample_spec`` to be skipped for NIRSpec fixed slit MultiSlitModel
  rateints input, because that mode is not allowed. [#7516]


1.10.0 (2023-04-03)
===================

assign_wcs
----------

- Fix ``WCS.bounding_box`` computation for MIRI MRS TSO observations so that it
  properly accounts for the 3D shape of the data. [#7492]

associations
------------

- Treat PSF exposures as science for Level 2 association processing, so that they
  too get linked background exposures associated with them, just like science
  target exposures. [#7508]

calwebb_detector1
-----------------

- Added the call to the undersampling_correction step to the ``calwebb_detector1``
  pipeline. [#7501]

- Added regression test for ``calwebb_detector1`` pipeline to include the new
  ``undersampling_correction`` step. [#7509]

cube_build
----------

- Windows: MSVC: Allocate ``wave_slice_dq`` array using ``mem_alloc_dq()`` [#7491]

- Memory improvements, do not allow MIRI and 'internal_cal', and allow user to
  set suffix for the output. [#7521]

datamodels
----------

- Move ``jwst.datamodels`` out of ``jwst`` into ``stdatamodels.jwst.datamodels``. [#7439]

documentation
-------------

- Fixed minor errors in the docs for EngDB, outlier_detection, and ramp fitting. [#7500]

- Update documentation for ``calwebb_detector1`` to include the undersampling_correction
  step. [#7510]

- Propagate ``DO_NOT_USE`` flags from MASK ref file to GROUPDQ array during
  dq initialization [#7447]

extract_1d
----------

- Fix the logic for handling the ``use_source_posn`` parameter, so that proper
  precedence is given for command line override, reference file settings, and
  internal decisions of the appropriate setting (in that order). [#7466]

- Edit surface brightness unit strings so that they can be properly parsed
  by ``astropy.units`` [#7511]

jump
----

- This has the changes in the JWST repo that allow new parameters to be passed to
  the STCAL code that made the following changes:
  Updated the code for both NIR Snowballs and MIRI Showers. The snowball
  flagging will now extend the saturated core of snowballs. Also,
  circles are no longer used for snowballs preventing the huge circles
  of flagged pixels from a glancing CR. Finally snowball flagging now has more stringent tests
  to prevent incorrect indentification of snowballs.
  Shower code is completely new and is now able to find extended
  emission far below the single pixel SNR. It also allows detected
  showers to flag groups after the detection. [#7478]

other
-----

- Update ``minimum_deps`` script to use ``importlib_metadata`` and ``packaging``
  instead of ``pkg_resources``. [#7457]

- Switch ``stcal.dqflags`` imports to ``stdatamodels.dqflags``. [#7475]

- Fix failing ``check-security`` job in CI. [#7496]

- Fix memory leaks in packages that use C code: ``cube_build``, ``wfss_contam``,
  and ``straylight``. [#7493]

- add `opencv-python` to hard dependencies for usage of snowball detection in the jump step in `stcal` [#7499]

  calibration applied, based on the slit-dependent source type (POINT or EXTENDED).
  [#7451]

- Correct units of ``photom_uniform`` array to MJy/sr for NIRSpec fixed
  slit data, to allow for expected behavior in ``master_background`` processing. [#7464]

pipeline
--------

- Update the calwebb_spec2 pipeline to move the MIRI MRS straylight step to before
  the flat-fielding step. [#7486]

- Update the calwebb_spec2 pipeline to make a deep copy of the current results before
  calling the ``resample_spec`` and ``extract_1d`` steps, to avoid issues with the
  input data accidentally getting modified by those steps. [#7451]

ramp_fitting
------------

- Changed computations for ramps that have only one good group in the 0th
  group.  Ramps that have a non-zero groupgap should not use group_time, but
  (NFrames+1)*TFrame/2, instead.  [#7461, spacetelescope/stcal#142]

- Update ramp fitting to calculate separate readnoise variance for processing
  ``undersampling_correction`` output [#7484]

resample
--------

- Added support for custom reference WCS for the resample steps. [#7442]

- Require minimum version of ``drizzle`` to be at least 1.13.7, which fixes
  a bug due to which parts of input images may not be present in the output
  resampled image under certain circumstances. [#7460]

- Carry through good bits correctly for the variance array [#7515]

residual_fringe
---------------

- Updated to provide proper handling of NaNs in input [#7471]

scripts
-------

- Added a script ``adjust_wcs.py`` to apply additional user-provided rotations
  and scale corrections to an imaging WCS of a calibrated image. [#7430]

- Update ``minimum_deps`` script to use ``importlib_metadata`` and ``packaging``
  instead of ``pkg_resources``. [#7457]

- Offload ``minimum_deps`` script to ``minimum_dependencies`` package [#7463]

set_telescope_pointing
----------------------

- Correct WCS determination for aperture MIRIM_TAMRS [#7449]

- Fill values of ``TARG_RA`` and ``TARG_DEC`` with ``RA_REF`` and ``DEC_REF``
  if target location is not provided, e.g. for pure parallel observations [#7512]

straylight
----------

- Updated to provide proper handling of NaNs in the input images. [#7455]

transforms
----------

- Fix the NIRISS SOSS transform in the manifest and converter so the correct tag
  is used and no warnings are issued by ASDF. [#7456]

- Move ``jwst.transforms`` out of ``jwst`` into ``stdatamodels.jwst.transforms``. [#7441]

- Update NIRCam WFSS transforms to use version 6 of GRISMCONF fileset; interpolate
  to create inverse dispersion relation due to third-order polynomial in use [#7018]

tweakreg
--------

- Added a ``utils.py`` module and a function (``adjust_wcs()``) to apply
  additional user-provided rotations and scale corrections to an imaging
  WCS of a calibrated image. [#7430]

- Fixed a bug due to which alignment may be aborted due to corrections
  being "too large" yet compatible with step parameters. [#7494]

- Added a trap for failures in source catalog construction, which now returns
  an empty catalog for the image on which the error occurred. [#7507]

- Fixed a crash occuring when alignment of a single image to an absolute
  astrometric catalog (e.g. Gaia) fails due to not enough sources in the
  catalog. [#7513]

undersampling_correction
------------------------

- New step between jump and ramp_fitting in the ``Detector1Pipeline``. [#7479]


1.9.6 (2023-03-09)
==================

associations
------------

- Ensure matched exposures generated by list of candidates continue processing,
  in order to avoid linked exposures - like backgrounds - from getting dropped
  from associations. [#7485]

1.9.5 (2023-03-02)
==================

- add ``opencv-python`` to ``requirements-sdp.txt`` to support snowball correction

1.9.4 (2023-01-27)
==================

associations
------------

----------

- Updated all transforms to be consistent with astropy v 4.0.
  Transform classes define now two class variables - ``n_inputs``
  and `n_outputs``. The variables ``inputs`` and ``outputs`` are
  now instance variables (previously they were class variables). [#4216]


0.14.0 (2019-10-25)
===================

- Remove references to deprecated collections.* ABCs that will be removed in
  Python 3.8. [#3732]

- Remove ``jwpsf`` module. [#3791]

- Update dependencies ``python>=3.6`` and ``numpy>=1.16``. [#4134]


ami
---

- Unit tests were added for the ami_analyze pipeline. [#4176]

assign_wcs
----------

- This step populates keyword DISPAXIS. [#3799]

- For NIRISS WFSS data, the wavelengths were incorrect because the function
  for horizontally oriented spectra was called for GR150R, and the function
  for vertically oriented spectra was called for GR150C. [#3891]


associations
------------
- Update level 3 rules to create image3 associations for FGS_IMAGE exposures [#3920]

- Add mir_taconfirm to the target acquisition exp_types [#4135]

- Exclude mir_lrs-slitless calibration data from level 3 processing [#3990]

- Fix in load_as_asn for UTF-8 errors [#3942]

- Update association rules so that MIMF exposures are processed as WFS observations [#4034]

- asn_from_list fills the level2  member exptype correctly if the input is a tuple [#2942]

- Update rules to make level 3 associations for slitless LRS mode [#3940]

- Update rules so that nOPS5 observations with "ALONG-SLIT-NOD" dither
   pattern generates level 3 associations [#3912]

- Update rules to have NRS_IFU backgrounds in science associations [#3824]

- Return filename with extensions based on file type [#2671]

- Add a check that backgrounds are included in level 3 associations [#3678]

- Will not constrain on uniqueness of the MSACONFIG keyword [#3770]

- Process non-science exposures taken during WFS&C observations [#3947]

barshadow
---------

- Update barshadow position [#3897]

- Unit tests were added. [#3930]

calwebb_tso3
-------------

- Update to exclude target_acquisitions from processing in the calwebb_tso3 pipeline [#3759]

cube_build
----------

- Schema for the ``WAVE-TAB`` WCS no longer requires fixed-length arrays for
  the wavelength "coordinates". The ``'nelem'`` field therefore is no longer
  necessary and has been removed. [#3976]

- To support outlier detection the blotting from the sky back to the detector was
  improved [#4301]

datamodels
----------

- Update to prevent target_acquisitions from processing in the spec3 pipeline [#3777]

- Use public API of jsonschema to ease upgrade to 3.x. [#3705]

- Fixed corruption of FITS tables with unsigned int columns. [#3736]

- Fixed missing TUNITn keywords caused by changes for unsigned int columns. [#3753]

- Write ``siaf_xref_sci`` and ``siaf_yref_sci`` to FITS keywords ``XREF_SCI``
  and ``YREF_SCI`` for ``NRC_TSGRISM`` exposures. [#3766]

- Updated multiexposure.schema to just import slitdata.schema instead of explicitly
  specifying all of its attributes. [#3809]

- Improved ``properties._cast()`` to be able to handle structured arrays
  schemas without a specified (in schema) shape. In addition, ``ndim``
  can be used to constrain the dimensionality of data in structured array
  fields. [#3976]

- Fixed an issue with the fix from [#3976] that was affecting "casting" to
  data types defined by schema of structured arrays when input values are not
  native Python types (tuples). [#3995]

- Fixed an issue with the fix from [#3995] that was affecting "casting" to
  data types defined by schema of structured arrays when input values are
  already structured arrays. [#4030]

- Added "MIR_TACONFIRM" to the list of allowed EXP_TYPE values in the
  keyword schemas. [#4039]

- Added new imaging-specific photom reference file data models ``FgsImgPhotomModel``,
  ``MirImgPhotomModel``, ``NrcImgPhotomModel``, and ``NisImgPhotomModel``. [#4052]

- Add EXP_TYPE and P_EXP_TY keywords to new imaging photom reference file
  data model schemas. [#4068]

- Introduced a flag ``ignore_missing_extensions=True`` to the `DataModel` initializer
  which is propagated to the ``asdf.open`` function. It allows control over a warning
  asdf issues when opening files written with an extension version older than the
  extension version the file was written with. An example message is

  ``asdf/asdf.py:202: UserWarning: File was created with extension
  'astropy.io.misc.asdf.extension.AstropyAsdfExtension' from package astropy-4.0.dev24515,
  but older version astropy-3.2.1 is installed``. [#4070]

- Added new spectroscopic mode photom reference file data models. [#4096]

- Added new imaging mode aperture correction (apcorr) reference file data
  models ``FgsImgApcorrModel``, ``MirImgApcorrModel``, ``NrcImgApcorrModel``,
  and ``NisImgApcorrModel``. [#4168]

- Removed old photom reference file data models. [#4173]

- Add support for streaming reference files directly from S3. [#4170]

exp_to_source
-------------

- Updated the documentation and added some logging to the step. [#3803]

- Close input files after creating the new outputs. [#3828]

extract_1d
----------

- Parameters were added to ``ExtractBase.__init__``, and most of the initialization
  is done there rather than in the subclasses. [#3714]

- This step uses keyword DISPAXIS. [#3799]

- Fixed a bug in ``pixel_area`` when the input is a ``CubeModel``. [#3827]

- Computing the solid angle of a pixel is only done for the first integration
  of a multi-integration exposure, and it's not done at all for WFSS data
  [#3863]

extract_2d
----------

- For grism data, this step copies keyword DISPAXIS from input to output. [#3799]

- For NIRCam TSO data, wavelengths are computed and assigned to the
  wavelength attribute. [#3863]

- Improved the computation of ``S_REGION`` of a slit. [#4111]

flat_field
----------

- For NIRSpec spectroscopic data, the flat_field step needs the dispersion
  direction.  The step now gets that information from keyword DISPAXIS.
  [#3799, #3807]

- The test_flatfield_step_interface unit test in test_flatfield.py has been
  temporarily disabled. [#3997]

gain_scale
----------

- Updated to apply gain factor to variance arrays. [#3794]

group_scale
-----------

- Updates to documentation and log messages. [#3738]

ipc
---

Function is_irs2 has been removed from x_irs2.py.  The version of this function
that is now in lib/pipe_utils.py is used instead. [#4054]

lib
---

- A function to determine the dispersion direction has been added. [#3756]

- Function is_irs2 has been added to pipe_utils.py, and unit tests were
  added to tests/test_pipe_utils.py. [#4054]

photom
------

- Add unit tests [#4022]

- The code was modified to work with the new photom reference files. [#4118]

- Two bugs were fixed.  For NIRSpec IFU data the code was trying to access
  an attribute of a "slit", but there were no slits for this type of data.
  For NIRISS extended-source data, the code tried to divide by the pixel
  area, but the pixel area was undefined.  [#4174]

- NRS_BRIGHTOBJ data were incorrectly treated the same as fixed-slit, but
  the data models are actually not the same.  Also, the logic for pixel area
  for fixed-slit data was incorrect. [#4179]

refpix
------

- Call is_irs2 from lib/pipe_utils.py instead of using PATTTYPE keyword to
  check for IRS2 readout mode. [#4054]

resample_spec
-------------

- This step uses keyword DISPAXIS and also copies it to output. [#3799]

saturation

tweakreg
--------

- Fixed a bug in a ``try-except`` block in the ``tweakreg`` step. [#4133]

The input DQ column is temporarily replaced by a zero-filled array of
the right data type. [#3666]

datamodels
----------

- Changed PATTSIZE keyword data type from float to string. [#3606]

- Added enumeration of allowed values of ``FXD_SLIT`` to the core schema. [#3584]

exp_to_source
-------------

- Changed `exp_to_source`` to use ``source_id`` to group exposures. [#3584]

- Removed the enum list for the SUBPXPAT keyword to allow validation of any value. [#3616]

extract_1d
----------

- Checks for input from a SourceModelContainer. [#3649]

extract_2d
----------

- Nircam ``TSGRISM`` extraction uses now ``wcsinfo.siaf_x(y)ref_sci`` as the source position
  on the detector. [#3646]

- For grism data, a wavelength array is computed and saved, and the variance
  arrays are extracted and copied to output. [#3664]

lib
---

- ``set_telescope_pointing`` now retrieves CRPIX1/2 from the SIAF for Nircam TSGRISM
  observations and saves the values as ``meta.wcsinfo.siaf_x(y)ref_sci``. These are used
  by ``extract_2d`` as the source position on the detector. [#3646]

outlier_detection
-----------------

- Changed default value of good_pixel from 4 to 6 [#3638]

- Don't use NaNs or masked values in weight image for blotting. [#3651]

- When calling cube_build for IFU data fixed selecting correct channels (MIRI) or

- Changed the default value of good_pixel from 4 to 6 for all outlier
  detection steps and both resample steps [#3638]

resample
--------

- Changed default value of good_pixel from 4 to 6 [#3638]

wfs_combine
-----------

- Allow handling of non-science members in input associations [#3947]


0.13.3 (2019-06-04)
===================

ami
---

- Fixed indentation bug in ami_analyze, so now all results are sufficiently
  close to the results of the stand-alone prototype. Other modifications include
  minor tweaks to more closely match those in the prototype code: changed some of
  initial values of the estimation parameters, and the filtering routine
  arguments.  [#3487]

- Updated ami_analyze.cfg to use default value of zero for rotation. [#3520]

- ``ami_analyze`` now emits a RuntimeError if the input is _calints or if a
  throughput reference file cannot be found.  [#3567]

- Remove change to filtering routine arguments of #3487.  [#3612]

assign_wcs
----------

- Fix a one pixel off problem with the NIRSpec NRS2 WCS transforms. [#3473]

- Raise a ``ValueError`` if the FWCPOS keyword isn't found in input NIRISS
  WFSS images. [#3574]

associations

- Orders the elements in Level3 naming in alphabetical order [#3614]

- Ensured that higher-order candidates only exist for Level2 associations [#3629]

- Improve member checking and removed duplicate product names [#3647]

combine_1d
----------

- Unit tests were added to combine_1d.  [#3490]

datamodels
----------

- Datamodels schemas should now be referenced with
  ``http://stsci.edu/schemas/jwst_datamodel/image.schema`` instead of
  ``http://jwst.stsci.edu/schemas/image.schema.yaml``.  The datamodels
  ``BaseExtension`` is renamed internally to ``DataModelExtension``. [#3437]

- Added the new column "relresperror" to the "MiriImgPhotomModel" data
  model schema. [#3512]

- Added all ``SlitModel`` data arrays to ``MultiExposureModel``, so that all input
  arrays appear in the output of ``exp_to_source``. [#3572]

extract_1d
----------

- An indexing bug was fixed. [#3497]

- Pixels with wavelength = NaN are no longer used. [#3539]

flatfield
---------

- Remove flatfield step parameter `flat_suffix`.  Add boolean step parameter
  `save_interpolated_flat`.  Refactor flatfield internals. [#3493]

- Propagate uncertainty from FFLAT, SFLAT and DFLAT flat fields into science
  ERR array and VAR_FLAT array for NIRSpec spectroscopic modes.  [#3538]

----

- Add multiprocessing capability to JumpStep [#3440]

extract_2d
----------

-----------------

- Fix bug in master_background where the flux from the input x1d files
  was being combined instead of the background columns.  [#3468]

photom
------

- Updated to zero-out pixels outside the wavelength range of flux calibration

pipeline
--------

- ``calwebb_spec3`` was changed to allow processing of WFSS modes. [#3517]

- ``calwebb_image2`` was changed to prevent 3D data from being sent to
  ``resample``. [#3544]

- ``calwebb_spec2`` was changed to check for an error in ``assign_wcs`` processing
  before executing the ``background`` step. [#3574]

refpix
------

- Fixed a bug where pixeldq arrays were being transformed from DMS to detector
  coordinates for every group instead of just once

skymatch
--------

- Improved reliability when matching sky in images with very close sky
  footprints. [#3557]

stpipe
------

- Capability to define reference overrides using a ``DataModel`` instead of
  a file path was added.  [#3514]

tweakreg
--------

- Mask and do not use NON-SCIENCE regions in tweakreg source detection. [#3461]


0.13.2 (2019-05-14)
===================

assign_wcs
----------

- The MIRI LRS WCS was updated to include an nverse transform. [#3106, #3360]

- The MIRI LRS spectral distortion is implemented now using a spline model. [#3106]

- Both ``dither_point_index`` and ``metadata_id`` are used now to match rows
  into the MSA meta file. [#3448]

- ``MissingMSAFileError`` was renamed to ``MSAFileError`` [#3448]

- Added two parameters to ``assign_wcs``, ``slit_y_low`` and ``slit_y_high``,
  to allow changing the lower and upper limit of a Nirspec slit in the instrument
  model. [#2819]

background
----------

- Verify the exposures to be used as background have the same NIRSpec GWA
  tilt values as the science exposures. If the background and science
  exposures do not have matching GWA tilt values, then skip the background
  subtraction step in calspec2. [#3252]

barshadow
---------

- Updated to apply the correction to the science data arrays, in addition
  to attaching as an extension. [#3319]

- Updated to apply the square of the correction to VAR_FLAT [#3427]

calwebb_spec3
-------------

- Add the ``master_background`` subtraction step to the pipeline. [#3296]

combine_1d
----------

- Fix call to wcs.invert, and don't weight flux by sensitivity if the net
  column is all zeros. [#3274]

- Modified to use the same columns as now written by extract_1d.
  The background parameter has been removed, since dividing by npixels
  is now done in extract_1d. [#3412]

datamodels
----------

- Fix ``url_mapper`` for fits-schema to allow URLs with of the format
  http://stsci.edu/schemas/fits-schema/ to map to the correct location
  in the ``jwst`` package. [#3239]

- Change ``ModelContainer`` to load and instantiate datamodels from an
  association on init.  This reverts #1027. [#3264]

- Keyword updates to data model schemas, including OBSFOLDR, MIRNGRPS,
  MIRNFRMS, and new PATTTYPE values. [#3266]

- Keyword updates to remove GS_STATE and change GUIDESTA to string
  type. [#3314]

- Added BUNIT keyword to gain and readnoise reference file schemas.
  [#3322]

- Update ``dq_def.schema``, ``group.schema`` and ``int_times.schema`` to comply
  with ASDF standard.  Remove unused ``extract1d.schema``.  [#3386]

- Update schemas to add new READPATT and BAND allowed values. [#3463]

extract_1d
----------

- This step can now use a reference image for IFU data.  The reference
  image (for IFU) may be either 2-D or 3-D.  When using a reference image
  for non-IFU data, background smoothing is now done after scaling the
  background count rate. [#3258]

- Unit tests were added for IFU data. [#3285]

- The target coordinates are used (for some modes) to determine the
  extraction location, i.e. correcting for nod/dither offset.  For IFU,
  the areas of the source aperture and background annulus are computed
  differently. [#3362

- For IFU data for an extended source, the extraction parameters are
  assigned values so that the entire image will be extracted, with no
  background subtraction.  For non-IFU data, a try/except block was added
  to check for a WCS that does not have an inverse.  Some code (but not
  all) for the now-obsolete RELSENS extension has been deleted. [#3390]

- This now writes columns SURF_BRIGHT and SB_ERROR instead of NET and
  NERROR.  The BACKGROUND column is divided by NPIXELS, so the units will
  be surface brightness.  This step no longer looks for a RELSENS
  extension. [#3412]

- The keywords that describe the units for the FLUX and ERROR columns
  have been corrected; the units are now specified as "Jy". [#3447]

extract_2d
----------

- An attribute ``dither_point`` was added to each slit in a ``MultiSlitModel``
  for MOS observations. [#3448]

flatfield
---------

- Propagate uncertainty from flat field into science ERR array and new
  VAR_FLAT array which holds the variance due to the flat field.  [#3384]

master_background
-----------------

- Modified the unit tests for ``expand_to_2d``. [#3242]

- Modified ``MasterBackgroundStep`` to be skipped if ``BackgroundStep``
  was already run on the data.  A new ``force_subtract`` parameter is
  added to override this logic.  [#3263]

- ``MasterBackgroundStep`` now can handle BACKGROUND association members
  that come from nodded exposures of the source. [#3311]

- Updated the DQFlags of the background subtracted data to be DO_NOT_USE
  for the pixels that have wavelengths outside the master background [#3326]

- Modified ``expand_to_2d`` to loop over pixels for WFSS data. [#3408]

outlier_detection
-----------------

- Fixed a bug that was causing the step to crash when calling the
  ``cube_build`` step for MIRI MRS data. [#3296]

pathloss
--------

- Updated to apply the correction to the science data and err arrays. [#3323]

- Updated to apply the square of the correction to VAR_FLAT [#3427]

photom
------

- Updated to apply the flux calibration to the science data and err arrays.
  [#3359]

- Updated to compute a wavelength array for NIRISS SOSS exposures using
  spectral order 1. [#3387]

- Updated to apply the square of the correction to VAR_FLAT [#3427]

reffile_utils
-------------

- Improved error messages when problems are encountered in extracting
  subarrays from reference files. [#3268]

resample_spec
-------------

- Fixed an issue with the spatial component of the WCS where the inverse
  transform gave different results for negative ``RA`` and ``360 + RA``. [#3404]


set_telescope_pointing
----------------------

- Fix ``populate_model_from_siaf`` to convert SIAF pixel scale from
  arcsec to degrees for CDELTn keywords. [#3248]

- Updates to prevent crashes when SIAF values needed for crpix or
  cdelt keywords are missing. [#3316]

- Convert FSM correction values from arcsec to radians. [#3367]

srctype
-------

- Updated logic for background targets and nodded exposures. [#3310]


transforms
----------

- A field ``dither_point`` was added to the ``Slit`` structure. [#3448]


tweakreg
--------

- Bug fix: Improved 2D Histogram (pre-match shift) algorithm in Python. [#3281]

- Fixed a bug in handling situations when no useable sources are
  detected in any of the input images. [#3286]

- Enhanced source catalog extraction algorithm to filter out sources outside
  the WCS domain of definition (when available). [#3292]

- Changed the type of exception raised when input has incorrect type. [#3297]

0.13.1 (2019-03-07)
===================

combine_1d
----------

- Added parameter ``background``; for background data, scale the flux,
  error, and net by 1 / NPIXELS, and include NPIXELS in the weight;
  changed the default for ``exptime_key`` to "exposure_time". [#3180]

- There is now a direct interface for calling the step.  This function,
  ``combine_1d_spectra``, may be passed either a ModelContainer or a
  MultiSpecModel object.  Previously this function expected the name of
  an association file. [#3220]

datamodels
----------

- Add back BaseExtension class so url-to-schema mapping works again [#3227]

extract_1d
----------

- If flux conversion is done, the FLUX is now set to zero (instead of
  copying the NET) if the wavelength of a pixel is outside the range of
  the RELSENS array. [#3190]

- Added a parameter ``subtract_background`` to ``extract_1d`` indicating
  whether the local background should be subtracted. If None, the value
  in the extract_1d reference file is used. [#3157, #3186]

- ``extract_1d`` can be run by calling ``extract.do_extract1d`` and
  passing a dictionary of reference file information. [#3202]

- ``ref_dict`` was None in ``run_extract1d``, and a check for that was
  missing. [#3233]

master_background
-----------------

- Added unit tests for expand_to_2d.  Support CombinedSpecModel data
  for the 1-D user-supplied background spectrum. [#3188]

set_bary_helio_times
--------------------

- Raise an exception when unable to compute converted times. [#3197]

set_telescope_pointing
----------------------

- Added population of CDELTn keywords based on SIAF values and fixed bug in calculation
  of S_REGION corners. [#3184]

0.13.0 (2019-02-15)
===================

ami
---

assign_wcs
----------

- Removed ``transform_bbox_from_datamodels`` in favor of
  ``transform_bbox_from_shape`` which now works by using last two dimensions
  in the ``shape``. [#3040]

- Added velocity correction model to the WFSS and TSGRISM wcs pipelines. [#2801]

- Refactored how the pipeline handles subarrays in the WCS. Fixed a bug
  where the bounding box was overwritten in full frame mode. [#2980]

- Rename several functions dealing with calculating bounding boxes for clarity. [#3014]

- The bounding box of the MIRI LRS WCS is now in "image" coordinates, not full frame. [#3063]

- FITS WCS keywords are written out only if the observation is one of the IMAGING_MODES. [#3066]

associations
------------

- Updated docstrings and written documentation. [#2856, #2862]

- Fixed NIRISS WFSS catalog naming and implement NIRCam WFSS [#3515]

- Fixed treating non-science as TSO [#3601]
