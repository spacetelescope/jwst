  data model schemas. [#4068]

- Introduced a flag ``ignore_missing_extensions=True`` to the `DataModel` initializer

  asdf issues when opening files written with an extension version older than the
  extension version the file was written with. An example message is

  ``asdf/asdf.py:202: UserWarning: File was created with extension
  'astropy.io.misc.asdf.extension.AstropyAsdfExtension' from package astropy-4.0.dev24515,

  is done there rather than in the subclasses. [#3714]

- This step uses keyword DISPAXIS. [#3799]

- Fixed a bug in ``pixel_area`` when the input is a ``CubeModel``. [#3827]

- Computing the solid angle of a pixel is only done for the first integration
  of a multi-integration exposure, and it's not done at all for WFSS data
  [#3863]

extract_2d
----------

- For grism data, this step copies keyword DISPAXIS from input to output. [#3799]

- For NIRCam TSO data, wavelengths are computed and assigned to the
  wavelength attribute. [#3863]

- Improved the computation of ``S_REGION`` of a slit. [#4111]

  direction.  The step now gets that information from keyword DISPAXIS.
  [#3799, #3807]

  For NIRISS extended-source data, the code tried to divide by the pixel
  area, but the pixel area was undefined.  [#4174]

- NRS_BRIGHTOBJ data were incorrectly treated the same as fixed-slit, but
  the data models are actually not the same.  Also, the logic for pixel area
  for fixed-slit data was incorrect. [#4179]

refpix
------

- Call is_irs2 from lib/pipe_utils.py instead of using PATTTYPE keyword to
  check for IRS2 readout mode. [#4054]

- For grism data, a wavelength array is computed and saved, and the variance
  arrays are extracted and copied to output. [#3664]

lib
---

- ``set_telescope_pointing`` now retrieves CRPIX1/2 from the SIAF for Nircam TSGRISM
  observations and saves the values as ``meta.wcsinfo.siaf_x(y)ref_sci``. These are used
  by ``extract_2d`` as the source position on the detector. [#3646]

-----------------

- Changed default value of good_pixel from 4 to 6 [#3638]

0.13.3 (2019-06-04)
===================

ami
---

- Fixed indentation bug in ami_analyze, so now all results are sufficiently
  close to the results of the stand-alone prototype. Other modifications include
  minor tweaks to more closely match those in the prototype code: changed some of

pipeline
--------

- ``calwebb_spec3`` was changed to allow processing of WFSS modes. [#3517]

- ``calwebb_image2`` was changed to prevent 3D data from being sent to
  ``resample``. [#3544]

- ``calwebb_spec2`` was changed to check for an error in ``assign_wcs`` processing
  before executing the ``background`` step. [#3574]

refpix
------

- Fixed a bug where pixeldq arrays were being transformed from DMS to detector
  coordinates for every group instead of just once

skymatch
--------

- Improved reliability when matching sky in images with very close sky
  footprints. [#3557]

stpipe
------

- Capability to define reference overrides using a ``DataModel`` instead of
  a file path was added.  [#3514]

tweakreg
--------

- Mask and do not use NON-SCIENCE regions in tweakreg source detection. [#3461]


0.13.2 (2019-05-14)
===================

assign_wcs
----------

- The MIRI LRS WCS was updated to include an nverse transform. [#3106, #3360]

- The MIRI LRS spectral distortion is implemented now using a spline model. [#3106]

- Both ``dither_point_index`` and ``metadata_id`` are used now to match rows
  into the MSA meta file. [#3448]

- ``MissingMSAFileError`` was renamed to ``MSAFileError`` [#3448]

- Added two parameters to ``assign_wcs``, ``slit_y_low`` and ``slit_y_high``,
  to allow changing the lower and upper limit of a Nirspec slit in the instrument
  model. [#2819]

background
----------

- Verify the exposures to be used as background have the same NIRSpec GWA
  tilt values as the science exposures. If the background and science
  exposures do not have matching GWA tilt values, then skip the background
  subtraction step in calspec2. [#3252]

barshadow
---------

- Updated to apply the correction to the science data arrays, in addition
  to attaching as an extension. [#3319]

- Updated to apply the square of the correction to VAR_FLAT [#3427]

calwebb_spec3
-------------

- Add the ``master_background`` subtraction step to the pipeline. [#3296]

combine_1d
----------

- Fix call to wcs.invert, and don't weight flux by sensitivity if the net
  column is all zeros. [#3274]

- Modified to use the same columns as now written by extract_1d.
  The background parameter has been removed, since dividing by npixels
  is now done in extract_1d. [#3412]

datamodels
----------

- Fix ``url_mapper`` for fits-schema to allow URLs with of the format
  http://stsci.edu/schemas/fits-schema/ to map to the correct location
  in the ``jwst`` package. [#3239]

- Change ``ModelContainer`` to load and instantiate datamodels from an
  association on init.  This reverts #1027. [#3264]

- Keyword updates to data model schemas, including OBSFOLDR, MIRNGRPS,
  MIRNFRMS, and new PATTTYPE values. [#3266]

- Keyword updates to remove GS_STATE and change GUIDESTA to string
  type. [#3314]

- Added BUNIT keyword to gain and readnoise reference file schemas.
  [#3322]

- Update ``dq_def.schema``, ``group.schema`` and ``int_times.schema`` to comply
  with ASDF standard.  Remove unused ``extract1d.schema``.  [#3386]

- Update schemas to add new READPATT and BAND allowed values. [#3463]

extract_1d
----------

- This step can now use a reference image for IFU data.  The reference
  image (for IFU) may be either 2-D or 3-D.  When using a reference image
  for non-IFU data, background smoothing is now done after scaling the
  background count rate. [#3258]

- Unit tests were added for IFU data. [#3285]

- The target coordinates are used (for some modes) to determine the
  extraction location, i.e. correcting for nod/dither offset.  For IFU,
  the areas of the source aperture and background annulus are computed
  differently. [#3362

- For IFU data for an extended source, the extraction parameters are
  assigned values so that the entire image will be extracted, with no
  background subtraction.  For non-IFU data, a try/except block was added
  to check for a WCS that does not have an inverse.  Some code (but not
  all) for the now-obsolete RELSENS extension has been deleted. [#3390]

- This now writes columns SURF_BRIGHT and SB_ERROR instead of NET and
  NERROR.  The BACKGROUND column is divided by NPIXELS, so the units will
  be surface brightness.  This step no longer looks for a RELSENS
  extension. [#3412]

- The keywords that describe the units for the FLUX and ERROR columns
  have been corrected; the units are now specified as "Jy". [#3447]

extract_2d
----------

- An attribute ``dither_point`` was added to each slit in a ``MultiSlitModel``
  for MOS observations. [#3448]

flatfield
---------

- Propagate uncertainty from flat field into science ERR array and new
  VAR_FLAT array which holds the variance due to the flat field.  [#3384]

master_background
-----------------

- Modified the unit tests for ``expand_to_2d``. [#3242]

- Modified ``MasterBackgroundStep`` to be skipped if ``BackgroundStep``
  was already run on the data.  A new ``force_subtract`` parameter is
  added to override this logic.  [#3263]

- ``MasterBackgroundStep`` now can handle BACKGROUND association members
  that come from nodded exposures of the source. [#3311]

- Updated the DQFlags of the background subtracted data to be DO_NOT_USE
  for the pixels that have wavelenghts outside the master background [#3326]

- Modified ``expand_to_2d`` to loop over pixels for WFSS data. [#3408]

outlier_detection
-----------------

- Fixed a bug that was causing the step to crash when calling the
  ``cube_build`` step for MIRI MRS data. [#3296]

pathloss
--------

- Updated to apply the correction to the science data and err arrays. [#3323]

- Updated to apply the square of the correction to VAR_FLAT [#3427]

photom
------

- Updated to apply the flux calibration to the science data and err arrays.
  [#3359]

- Updated to compute a wavelength array for NIRISS SOSS exposures using
  spectral order 1. [#3387]

- Updated to apply the square of the correction to VAR_FLAT [#3427]

reffile_utils
-------------

- Improved error messages when problems are encountered in extracting
  subarrays from reference files. [#3268]

resample_spec
-------------

- Fixed an issue with the spatial component of the WCS where the inverse
  transform gave different results for negative ``RA`` and ``360 + RA``. [#3404]


set_telescope_pointing
----------------------

- Fix ``populate_model_from_siaf`` to convert SIAF pixel scale from
  arcsec to degress for CDELTn keywords. [#3248]

- Updates to prevent crashes when SIAF values needed for crpix or
  cdelt keywords are missing. [#3316]

- Convert FSM correction values from arcsec to radians. [#3367]

srctype
-------

- Updated logic for background targets and nodded exposures. [#3310]


transforms
----------

- A field ``dither_point`` was added to the ``Slit`` structure. [#3448]


tweakreg
--------

- Bug fix: Improved 2D Histogram (pre-match shift) algorithm in Python. [#3281]

- Fixed a bug in handling situations when no useable sources are
  detected in any of the input images. [#3286]

- Enhanced source catalog extraction algorithm to filter out sources outside
  the WCS domain of definition (when available). [#3292]

- Changed the type of exception raised when input has incorrect type. [#3297]

0.13.1 (2019-03-07)
===================

combine_1d
----------

- Added parameter ``background``; for background data, scale the flux,
  error, and net by 1 / NPIXELS, and include NPIXELS in the weight;
  changed the default for ``exptime_key`` to "exposure_time". [#3180]

- There is now a direct interface for calling the step.  This function,
  ``combine_1d_spectra``, may be passed either a ModelContainer or a
  MultiSpecModel object.  Previously this function expected the name of
  an association file. [#3220]

datamodels
----------

- Add back BaseExtension class so url-to-schema mapping works again [#3227]

extract_1d
----------

- If flux conversion is done, the FLUX is now set to zero (instead of
  copying the NET) if the wavelength of a pixel is outside the range of
  the RELSENS array. [#3190]

- Added a parameter ``subtract_background`` to ``extract_1d`` indicating
  whether the local background should be subtracted. If None, the value
  in the extract_1d reference file is used. [#3157, #3186]

- ``extract_1d`` can be run by calling ``extract.do_extract1d`` and
  passing a dictionary of reference file information. [#3202]

- ``ref_dict`` was None in ``run_extract1d``, and a check for that was
  missing. [#3233]

master_background
-----------------

- Added unit tests for expand_to_2d.  Support CombinedSpecModel data
  for the 1-D user-supplied background spectrum. [#3188]

set_bary_helio_times
--------------------

- Raise an exception when unable to compute converted times. [#3197]

set_telescope_pointing
----------------------

- Added population of CDELTn keywords based on SIAF values and fixed bug in calculation
  of S_REGION corners. [#3184]

0.13.0 (2019-02-15)
===================

ami
---

assign_wcs
----------

- Removed ``transform_bbox_from_datamodels`` in favor of
  ``transform_bbox_from_shape`` which now works by using last two dimensions
  in the ``shape``. [#3040]

- Added velocity correction model to the WFSS and TSGRISM wcs pipelines. [#2801]

- Refactored how the pipeline handles subarrays in the WCS. Fixed a bug
  where the bounding box was overwritten in full frame mode. [#2980]

- Rename several functions dealing with calculating bounding boxes for clarity. [#3014]

- The bounding box of the MIRI LRS WCS is now in "image" coordinates, not full frame. [#3063]

  value of 0. [#2911]

- Reverse order of RELSENS wavelength and response if the wavelengths are
  not increasing. [#3005]

- Add a test for constant wavelengths (or constant slope). [#3032]
