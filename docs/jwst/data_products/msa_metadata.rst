MSA Meta Data File: ``msa``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
While not containing any actual science data, the NIRSpec MSA meta data file is nonetheless
a crucial component of calibration processing for NIRSpec MOS exposures.
It contains all the slitlet, shutter, and source configuration information that's needed
by the :ref:`calwebb_spec2 <calwebb_spec2>` pipeline to process a MOS exposure.
These meta data are originally generated by the
`MSA Planning Tool <https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/display/JDOX/.NIRSpec+MSA+Planning+Tool%2C+MPT+v2.0>`_
(MPT) in APT and passed through the ground system to populate the
FITS metafile. Details of the meta data and how it is used in calibration processing
are given below.

File names for MSA meta data files are of the form:

 jw<ppppp><ooo><vvv>_<cfg>_msa.fits

where

 - ppppp: program ID number
 - ooo: observation number
 - vvv: visit number
 - cfg: MSA configuration

such as `jw01180025001_01_msa.fits`.

Each MOS science exposure contains a primary header keyword `MSAMETFL` that gives
the name of the MSA meta data file to be used when processing the exposure.
The values of the primary header keywords `MSAMETID` and `PATT_NUM` are also used
when retrieving relevant rows of data from the tables in the MSA meta data file.
If any of these keywords is missing from the input science exposure, processing
will not be able to proceed and an error will be raised.

File Structure
--------------
The overall structure of the MSA FITS file is as follows:

+-----+---------------+----------+-----------+--------------------+
| HDU | EXTNAME       | HDU Type | Data Type | Dimensions         |
+=====+===============+==========+===========+====================+
|  0  | N/A           | primary  | N/A       | N/A                |

+-----+---------------+----------+-----------+--------------------+
|  3  | SOURCE_INFO   | BINTABLE | N/A       | variable x 8 cols  |
+-----+---------------+----------+-----------+--------------------+

 - PRI: The primary data array is empty. The primary header contains a small amount of
   meta data related to the observation and MSA configuration.
 - SHUTTER_IMAGE: 2-D data array containing a map of MSA shutters that've been commanded
   open for this MSA configuration.
 - SHUTTER_INFO: 2-D FITS binary table containing meta data for each shutter
   involved in this MSA configuration. One table row per shutter.
 - SOURCE_INFO: 2-D FITS binary table containing meta data from the source catalog
   used to create the MSA configuration. One table row per source.

The structure of the ``SHUTTER_INFO`` table extension is as follows:

The SHUTTER_INFO Meta Data
--------------------------
It is the :ref:`assign_wcs <assign_wcs_step>` step in the
:ref:`calwebb_spec2 <calwebb_spec2>` pipeline that opens and loads all
of the necessary information from the MSA meta data file. For each slitlet that
it identifies as being used in the current exposure, a ``Slit`` object is
created and populated with all the shutter and source information needed in
subsequent processing steps. The list of ``Slit`` objects is attached to the
data model for the exposure being processed and passed along to all subsequent
calibration steps.

For a given exposure, only table rows
where the values of `MSAMETID` and `PATT_NUM` in the science exposure match
the values of `msa_metdata_id` and `dither_point_index`, respectively, are
loaded, so that it's only dealing with meta data that apply to the science
exposure being processed.

To better understand the ways in which those meta data are used, it's useful to
reference a hypothetical example of data within a ``SHUTTER_INFO`` table.
The table below shows the first 9 rows of a ``SHUTTER_INFO`` table for a MOS exposure
that's part of a standard 3-point nod MOS observation, in which the sources
are moved to different shutters within each slitlet from one exposure to
another in the observation. Only the data for slitlet 2 are shown. In this example,
slitlet 2 is comprised of 3 shutters. Because a 3-point nod pattern has been used,
there are 3 different sets of meta data for each slitlet (one set for each dither/nod
position) and hence a total of 9 entries (3 shutters x 3 dithers).

+------+------+------+-----+-----+--------+-----+-------+-------+-------+------+-----+
| Slit | Meta |      |     |     |   Src  |     |       |  X    |  Y    | Dith | Pri |
|      |      |      |     |     |        |     |       |       |       |      |     |
| ID   | ID   | Quad | Row | Col |   ID   | Bkg | State |  pos  |  pos  | Pt   | Src |

+------+------+------+-----+-----+--------+-----+-------+-------+-------+------+-----+

The values in the `slitlet_id` column show that we're only looking at table
rows for slitlet 2, all of which come from MSA configuration (`msa_metadata_id`) 1.
The shutters that make up slitlet 2 are all contained in MSA quadrant 2 and are located in
row 10 of that quadrant. The 3 shutters making up slitlet 2 span MSA columns 154, 155, and 156.
The remaining table entries in each row vary depending on whether a source is located in
a given shutter for each dither/nod position. You can see that the source is located in
shutter column 155 in dither position 1, 154 in dither position 2, and 156 in dither position 3.
The `source_id` column shows that source 42 is in those shutter positions for those dithers.
The `background` column, meanwhile, indicates whether a given shutter only has background
signal in it for each dither position.

When there is a source in a shutter, the `estimated_source_in_shutter_x` and
`estimated_source_in_shutter_y` columns are populated with numerical values that
estimate the source location in the shutter. These are fractional position values that
run from 0,0 at the lower-left corner of a shutter to 1,1 at the upper-right corner
(hence 0.5,0.5 indicates the shutter center). These source positions are used in
calibration steps such as :ref:`wavecorr <wavecorr_step>` and :ref:`pathloss <pathloss_step>`
to compute the appropriate corrections.

The flags in the `primary_source` column are used to identify which shutter
within each slitlet should be considered the "primary" shutter. This is especially
important for slitlets that contain extended sources and hence the `source_id` and
`background` entries may indicate that the source is present in multiple shutters.

When a slitlet is found that has no shutters with a primary source (i.e. no shutters
having `primary_source` = "Y"), it is classified as a background slitlet and assigned
a source ID value that's greater than the maximum source ID assigned to other slitlets
(because such slitlets all have a source ID of zero in the MSA meta data coming from
the ground system).
These background slitlets can then be used in :ref:`master background <master_background_step>`
subtraction.


The SOURCE_INFO Meta Data
-------------------------
The table below shows an example of a few rows of hypothetical source meta data,
consisting of the program ID, source ID, source name, source alias, source RA and Dec,
pre-image ID, and source stellarity.

+------+------+-----------+-------+------------+-------------+--------------+------------+
|      | Src  |   Src     |       |            |             | Pre          |            |

+------+------+-----------+-------+------------+-------------+--------------+------------+

For each slitlet identified as having a source assigned to it in the shutter meta data,
the source name, alias, RA, Dec, and stellarity are retreived from the `SOURCE_INFO`
table and stored with the ``Slit`` object created in the calibration software.
The stellarity values in particular will be used in the :ref:`source type <srctype_step>`
step to determine whether the source should be treated as point-like or extended.
