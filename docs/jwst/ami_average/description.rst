Description
-----------

:Class: `jwst.ami.AmiAverageStep`
:Alias: ami_average

The ``ami_average`` step is one of the AMI-specific steps in the ``ami``
sub-package and is part of Stage 3 :ref:`calwebb_ami3 <calwebb_ami3>` processing.
It averages the results of LG processing from the
:ref:`ami_analyze <ami_analyze_step>` step for multiple exposures of a given target.
It computes a simple average for all 8 components of the "_ami" product files from all
input exposures.

Arguments
---------
The ``ami_average`` step does not have any step-specific arguments.

Inputs
------

LG model parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Data model: `~jwst.datamodels.AmiLgModel`
:File suffix: _ami

The only input to the ``ami_average`` step is a list of one or more "_ami" files to be
processed. These should be output files from the
:ref:`ami_analyze <ami_analyze_step>` step. The input to the step must be in the form
of a list of "_ami" **file names**. Passing data models or ASN files is not supported
at this time. Use the :ref:`calwebb_ami3 <calwebb_ami3>` pipeline to conveniently
process multiple inputs.

Outputs
-------

Average LG model parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Data model: `~jwst.datamodels.AmiLgModel`
:File suffix: _amiavg or _psf-amiavg

The ``ami_average`` step produces a single output file, having the same format as the input
files, where the data for the 8 file components are the averages from the list of input files.
If the inputs in the ASN file are designated as "science", the output product type will be
"_amiavg", whereas if the inputs are designated as "psf", the output product type will be
"_psf-amiavg." The output file name syntax is source-based, using the product name specified
in the input ASN file, e.g. "jw87600-a3001_t001_niriss_f480m-nrm_amiavg.fits."

Reference Files
---------------
The ``ami_average`` step does not use any reference files.
