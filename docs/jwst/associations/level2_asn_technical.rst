Stage 2 Associations: Technical Specifications
==============================================

Logical Structure
-----------------

All stage 2 associations have the following structure. The structure is defined
and enforced by the stage 2 schema.

  * :ref:`Informational Meta Keywords<asn-level2-meta-keywords>`
  * List of :ref:`products<asn-level2-products>`, each consisting of
    
    * Output product name
    * List of :ref:`exposure members<asn-level2-members>`, each consisting of
      
      * Filename of the exposure that is a member of this association
      * Type of exposure
      * If present, information about errors from the observatory log

The following example will be used to explain the contents of an association::

                ]
            }
        ]
    }

.. _asn-level2-meta-keywords:

Association Meta Keywords
-------------------------

The following are the informational, meta keywords of an association.

asn_id *required*
  The association id. The id is what appears in the :ref:`asn-jwst-naming`
  
asn_pool *required*
  Association pool from which this association was created.

asn_rule *optional*
  Name of the association rule which created this association.

asn_type *optional*
  The type of association represented. See :ref:`asn-jwst-association-types`

code_version *optional*
  The version of the generator that created this association. Typically this is the version
  of the jwst python package.

constraints *optional*
  List of constraints used by the association generator to create this
  association. Format and contents are determined by the defining
  rule.

degraded_status *optional*
  If any of the included members have an actual issue,
  as reported by the ``exposerr`` keyword, ``degraded_status`` will have the
  value ``One or more members have an error associated with them.`` If no errors
  are indicated, the value will be ``No known degraded exposures in
  association.``

program *optional*
  Program number for which this association was created.

target *optional*
  Target ID for which this association refers to. JWST currently uses
  the TARGETID header keyword in the stage 2 exposure files, but there
  is no formal restrictions on value.
  
version_id *optional*
  Version identifier. DMS uses a time stamp with the format
  ``yyyymmddthhmmss``
  Can be None or NULL

.. _asn-level2-products:

``products`` Keyword
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A list of products that would be produced by this association. For
stage 2, each product is an exposure. Each product should have one
``science`` member, the exposure on which the stage 2 processing will
occur.

Association products have two components: 

name *optional*
  The string template to be used by stage 2 processing tasks to create
  the output file names. The product name, in general, is a prefix on
  which the individual pipeline and step modules will append whatever
  suffix information is needed.

  If not specified, the stage 2 processing modules will create a name
  based off the name of the ``science`` member.

members *required*
  This is a list of the exposures to be used by the stage 2 processing
  tasks. This keyword is explained in detail in the next section.

.. _asn-level2-members:

``members`` Keyword
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``members`` is a list of dictionaries, one for each member exposure in the
association. Each member has the following keywords.

expname *required*
  The exposure file name

exptype *required*
  Type of information represented by the exposure. Possible
  values are as follows. *Note that this is not the same as the exposure
  ``EXP_TYPE`` header keyword.*

  * ``science``: Primary science exposure. For each product, only one exposure can
    be ``science``.
    
  * ``background``: Background exposure to subtract.
    
  * ``imprint``: Imprint exposure to subtract.
    
  * ``sourcecat``: The catalog of sources to extract spectra for. Usually produced by
    :ref:`calwebb_image3 <calwebb_image3>` for wide-field slitless spectroscopy.

  * ``segmap``: The 2D segmentation map used to produce the source catalog. Usually produced by
    :ref:`calwebb_image3 <calwebb_image3>` for wide-field slitless spectroscopy.

  * ``direct_image``: The direct image used to produce the source catalog.

Editing the member list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As discussed previously, a member is made up of a number of keywords,
formatted as follows::

  {
      "expname": "jw_00003_cal.fits",
      "exptype": "science",
  },

To remove a member, simply delete its corresponding set.

To add a member, one need only specify the two required keywords::

  {
      "expname": "jw_00003_cal.fits",
      "exptype": "science"
  },
