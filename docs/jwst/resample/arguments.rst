Step Arguments
==============
The `resample` step has the following optional arguments that control
the behavior of the processing and the characteristics of the resampled
image.

``--pixfrac`` (float, default=1.0)
  The fraction by which input pixels are "shrunk" before being drizzled
  onto the output image grid, given as a real number between 0 and 1.

``--kernel`` (str, default='square')
  The form of the kernel function used to distribute flux onto the output
  image.  Available kernels are `square`, `gaussian`, `point`, `tophat`, `turbo`,
  `lanczos2`, and `lanczos3`.

``--pixel_scale_ratio`` (float, default=1.0)
  Ratio of input to output pixel scale.  A value of 0.5 means the output image
  would have 4 pixels sampling each input pixel. Ignored when ``pscale`` are provided.

``--pixel_scale`` (float, default=None)
    Absolute pixel scale in ``arcsec``. When provided, overrides
    ``pixel_scale_ratio``.

``--rotation`` (float, default=None)
    Position angle of output imageâ€™s Y-axis relative to North.
    A value of 0.0 would orient the final output image to be North up.
    The default of `None` specifies that the images will not be rotated,
    but will instead be resampled in the default orientation for the camera
    with the x and y axes of the resampled image corresponding
    approximately to the detector axes. Ignored when ``transform`` is
    provided.

``--output_shape`` (tuple of int, default=None)
    Shape of the image (data array) using "standard" ``nx`` first and ``ny``
    second (as opposite to the ``numpy.ndarray`` convention - ``ny`` first and
    ``nx`` second). This value will be assigned to
    ``pixel_shape`` and ``array_shape`` properties of the returned
    WCS object. When supplied from command line, it should be a comma-separated
    list of integers ``nx, ny``.

``--crpix`` (tuple of float, default=None)
    Position of the reference pixel in the image array in the ``x, y`` order.
    If ``crpix`` is not specified, it will be set to the center of the bounding
    box of the returned WCS object. When supplied from command line, it should
    be a comma-separated list of floats.

``--crval`` (tuple of float, default=None)
    Right ascension and declination of the reference pixel. Automatically
    computed if not provided. When supplied from command line, it should be a
    comma-separated list of floats.

``--fillval`` (str, default='INDEF')
  The value to assign to output pixels that have zero weight or do not
  receive any flux from any input pixels during drizzling.

``--weight_type`` (str, default='ivm')
  The weighting type for each input image.
  If `weight_type=ivm` (the default), the scaling value
  will be determined per-pixel using the inverse of the read noise
  (VAR_RNOISE) array stored in each input image. If the VAR_RNOISE array does
  not exist, the variance is set to 1 for all pixels (equal weighting).
  If `weight_type=exptime`, the scaling value will be set equal to the exposure
  time found in the image header.

``--single`` (bool, default=False)
  If set to `True`, resample each input image into a separate output.  If
  `False` (the default), each input is resampled additively (with weights) to
  a common output

``--blendheaders`` (bool, default=True)
  Blend metadata from all input images into the resampled output image.

``--allowed_memory`` (float, default=None)
  Specifies the fractional amount of free memory to allow when creating the
  resampled image. If ``None``, the environmental variable
  ``DMODEL_ALLOWED_MEMORY`` is used. If not defined, no check is made. If the
  resampled image would be larger than specified, an ``OutputTooLargeError``
  exception will be generated.

  For example, if set to ``0.5``, only resampled images that use less than half
  the available memory can be created.
