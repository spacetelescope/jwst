Reference Selection Keywords for REGIONS
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CRDS selects appropriate REGIONS references based on the following keywords.
REGIONS is not applicable for instruments not in the table.
All keywords used for file selection are *required*.

Reference File Format
+++++++++++++++++++++
The IFU takes a region reference file that defines the pixels on the detector that map to the sky and which
IFU slice they correspond to.  The reference file is a three-dimensional array
measuring 1032 x 1024 x 9.  Each of the nine planes within the array represents
a two-dimensional detector image for which each pixel has a value indicating the slice to which it belongs.
Negative values represent slice pixels that receive light from the sky but for data quality reasons
are not mapped to the sky using the world coordinate solution.
The nine planes each correspond to different throughput thresholds ranging from 10% - 90%; these differ slightly
in the effective along-slice size.

:channel: The MIRI channels in the observation, e.g. "12".
:band: The band for the observation (one of "LONG", "MEDIUM", "SHORT").
:regions: An array with the size of the MIRI MRS image where pixel values map to the MRS slice number. 0 indicates a pixel is not within any slice.
