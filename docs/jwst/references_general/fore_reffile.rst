Reference File Format
+++++++++++++++++++++
The FORE reference file stores the transform through the Filter Wheel Assembly (FWA).
It has two fields - “filter” and “model”. The transform through the FWA is chromatic.
It is represented as a Polynomial of two variables whose coefficients are wavelength dependent.
The compound model takes three inputs - x, y positions and wavelength.

:filter: Filter name.
:model: Transform through the Filter Wheel Assembly (FWA).
