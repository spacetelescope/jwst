Reference File Format
+++++++++++++++++++++
The FPA reference file stores information on the metrology of the Focal Plane Assembly (FPA),
which consists of two Sensor Chip Arrays (SCA), named NRS1 and NRS2.

The reference file contains two fields : “nrs1_model” and “nrs2_model”.
Each of them stores the transform (shift and rotation) to transform positions
from the FPA to the respective SCA. The output units are in pixels.

:nrs1_model: Transform for the NRS1 detector.
:nrs2_model: Transform for the NRS2 detector.
