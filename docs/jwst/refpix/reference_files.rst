Reference Files
===============

The ``refpix`` step uses a REFPIX reference file when
processing NIRSpec exposures that have been acquired using an IRS2
readout pattern.

For other full-frame NIR instruments and modes, when the optional SIRS algorithm
is selected, the ``refpix`` step uses a SIRSKERNEL reference file.
