:Class: `jwst.assign_wcs.AssignWcsStep`
:Alias: assign_wcs


``jwst.assign_wcs`` is run in the beginning of the level 2B JWST pipeline.
It associates a WCS object with each science exposure. The WCS object transforms
positions in the detector frame to positions in a world coordinate frame - ICRS and wavelength.
In general there may be intermediate coordinate frames depending on the instrument.
The WCS is saved in the ASDF extension of the FITS file. It can be accessed as an attribute of
the meta object when the fits file is opened as a data model.

The forward direction of the transforms is from detector to world coordinates
and the input positions are 0-based.

``jwst.assign_wcs`` expects to find the basic WCS keywords in the
SCI header. Distortion and spectral models are stored in reference files in the
`ASDF <http://asdf-standard.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__  format.

For each observing mode, determined by the value of ``EXP_TYPE`` in the science header,
assign_wcs retrieves reference files from CRDS and creates a pipeline of transforms from
input frame ``detector`` to a frame ``v2v3``. This part of the WCS pipeline may include
intermediate coordinate frames. The basic WCS keywords are used to create
the transform from frame ``v2v3`` to frame ``world``.

For image display with software like DS9 that relies on specific WCS information, a SIP-based
approximation to the WCS is fit. The results are FITS keywords stored in
``model.meta.wcsinfo``. This is not an exact fit, but is accurate to ~0.25 pixel and is sufficient
for display purposes. This step, which occurs for imaging modes early, is performed by default but
can be switched off, and parameters controlling the fit can also be adjusted.


``jwst.assign_wcs`` is based on `gwcs <https://gwcs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ and
uses `asdf <http://asdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.



Basic WCS keywords and the transform from ``v2v3`` to ``world``
---------------------------------------------------------------

All JWST instruments use the following FITS header keywords to
define the transform from ``v2v3`` to ``world``:

``RA_REF``, ``DEC_REF`` - a fiducial point on the sky, ICRS, [deg]

``V2_REF``, ``V3_REF`` - a point in the V2V3 system which maps to ``RA_REF``, ``DEC_REF``, [arcsec]

``ROLL_REF`` - local roll angle associated with each aperture, [deg]

``RADESYS`` - standard coordinate system [ICRS]

These quantities are used to create a 3D Euler angle rotation between the V2V3 spherical system,
associated with the telescope, and a standard celestial system.

For spectroscopic data, ``jwst.assign_wcs`` populates keyword ``DISPAXIS``
with an integer value that indicates whether the dispersion direction is
oriented more nearly along the horizontal (DISPAXIS = 1) or vertical
(DISPAXIS = 2) direction.


Using the WCS interactively
---------------------------

Once a FITS file is opened as a `DataModel` the WCS can be accessed as an attribute
of the meta object. Calling it as a function with detector positions as inputs returns the
corresponding world coordinates. Using MIRI LRS fixed slit as an example:

.. doctest-skip::

  >>> from stdatamodels.jwst.datamodels import ImageModel
  >>> exp = ImageModel('miri_fixedslit_assign_wcs.fits')
  >>> ra, dec, lam = exp.meta.wcs(x, y)
  >>> print(ra, dec, lam)
      (329.97260532549336, 372.0242999250267, 5.4176100046836675)

The WFSS modes for NIRCam and NIRISS have a slightly different calling structure,
in addition to the (x, y) coordinate, they need to know other information about the
spectrum or source object. In the JWST backward direction (going from the sky to
the detector) the WCS model also looks for the wavelength and order and returns
the (x,y) location of that wavelength+order on the dispersed image and the original
source pixel location, as entered, along with the order that was specified:

.. doctest-skip::

  >>> from stdatamodels.jwst.datamodels import ImageModel
  >>> exp = ImageModel('nircam_wfss_assign_wcs.fits')
  >>> x, y, x0, y0, order = exp.meta.wcs(x0, y0, wavelength, order)
  >>> print(x0, y0, wavelength, order)
      (365.523884327, 11.6539963919, 2.557881113, 2)
  >>> print(x, y, x0, y0, order)
      (1539.5898464615102, 11.6539963919, 365.523884327, 11.6539963919, 2)


The WCS provides access to intermediate coordinate frames
and transforms between any two frames in the WCS pipeline in forward or
backward direction. For example, for a NIRSpec fixed slits exposure,
which has been through the extract_2d step:

.. doctest-skip::

  >>> exp = datamodels.MultiSlitModel('nrs1_fixed_assign_wcs_extract_2d.fits')
  >>> exp.slits[0].meta.wcs.available_frames
      ['detector', 'sca', 'bgwa', 'slit_frame', 'msa_frame', 'ote', 'v2v3', 'world']
  >>> msa2detector = exp.slits[0].meta.wcs.get_transform('msa_frame', 'detector')
  >>> msa2detector(0, 0, 2*10**-6)
      (5042.064255529629, 1119.8937888372516)

For each exposure, assign_wcs uses reference files and WCS header keywords
to create the WCS object. What reference files are retrieved
from CRDS is determined based on EXP_TYPE and other keywords in the science file header.

The assign_wcs step can accept the single slope image that is the result of averaging
over all integrations or a 3D cube of integrations in the case of TSO exposures.

WCS of slitless grism exposures
-------------------------------

The WCS forward transforms for slitless grism exposures (``NIS_WFSS``, ``NRC_WFSS``, ``NRC_TSGRISM``)
take as input the ``x, y`` coordinates on the dispersed image, the ``x0, y0`` coordinate of
the center of the object in the direct image and ``spectral order``. They return the ``x0, y0`` coordinate of the center
of the object in the direct image, ``wavelength`` and ``spectral order``.

For NIRISS WFSS data the reference files contain a reference value for the filter wheel
position angle. The trace is rotated about an angle which is the difference between
the reference and actual angles.

For WFSS modes (``NIS_WFSS``, ``NRC_WFSS``), an approximation of the GWCS object
associated with a direct image with the same instrument configuration as the grism image
is saved as FITS WCS in the headers of grism images.

Corrections Due to Spacecraft Motion
------------------------------------

The WCS transforms contain two corrections due to motion of the observatory.

Absolute velocity aberration is calculated onboard when acquiring the guide star, but
differential velocity aberration effects are calculated during the ``assign_wcs`` step.
This introduces corrections in the conversion from sky coordinates to observatory
V2/V3 coordinates, and is stored in the WCS under the ``v2v3vacorr`` frame.

For spectroscopic data, a relativistic Doppler correction is applied to all wavelengths to place
observations into the barycentric reference frame. This correction factor is applied to the WCS
wavelength solution created during the ``assign_wcs`` step, such that extracted spectral products
will have wavelength arrays in the barycentric frame.
