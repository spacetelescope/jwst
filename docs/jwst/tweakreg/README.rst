:Class: `jwst.tweakreg.TweakRegStep`
:Alias: tweakreg

Overview
--------
This step creates image catalogs of point-like sources whose
centroids are then used to compute corrections to the WCS of
the input images such that sky catalogs obtained from the
image catalogs using the corrected WCS will align on the sky.

Source Detection
----------------
Stars are detected in the image using the Photutils "daofind" function.
Photutils.daofind is an implementation of the `DAOFIND`_ algorithm
(`Stetson 1987, PASP 99, 191
<http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987PASP...99..191S>`_).  It searches
images for local density maxima that have a peak amplitude greater
than a specified threshold (the threshold is applied to a convolved
image) and have a size and shape similar to a defined 2D Gaussian
kernel.  Photutils.daofind also provides an estimate of the objects
roundness and sharpness, whose lower and upper bounds can be
specified.

Alignment
---------
The source catalogs for each input image are compared to each other
and linear (affine) coordinate transformations that align these
catalogs are derived.  This fit insures that all the input images
are aligned relative to each other.  This step produces a combined
source catalog for the entire set of input images as if they were
combined into a single mosaic.

If the step parameter `align_to_gaia` is True, an astrometric
reference catalog then gets generated by querying
a GAIA-based astrometric catalog web service for all astrometrically
measured sources in the combined field-of-view of the set of input
images. This catalog gets generated from the catalogs available
through the GSSS STScI web services at `GSSSCATALOGS`_.

.. _GSSSCATALOGS: http://gsss.stsci.edu/Catalogs/Catalogs.htm

The combined source catalog derived in the first step
then gets cross-matched and fit to this astrometric reference catalog.
The pipeline initially supports fitting to the
GAIADR2 catalog, with the option to select the GAIADR1 instead.
The results of this one fit then gets back-propagated to all the
input images to align them all to the astrometric reference frame while
maintaining the relative alignment between the images.


WCS Correction
--------------
The linear coordinate transformation computed in the previous step
is used to define tangent-plane corrections that need to be applied
to the GWCS pipeline in order to correct input image WCS.
This correction is implemented by inserting a ``v2v3corr`` frame with
tangent plane corrections into the GWCS pipeline of the image's WCS.

Step Arguments
--------------
The ``tweakreg`` step has the following optional arguments:

**Source finding parameters:**

* ``save_catalogs``: A boolean indicating whether or not the catalogs should
  be written out. (Default=`False`)

* ``catalog_format``: A `str` indicating catalog output file format.
  (Default='ecsv')

* ``kernel_fwhm``: A `float` value indicating the Gaussian kernel FWHM in
  pixels. (Default=2.5)

* ``snr_threshold``: A `float` value indicating SNR threshold above the
  background. (Default=5.0)

* ``brightest``: A positive `int` value indicating the number of brightest
  objects to keep. (Default=200)

* ``peakmax``: A `float` value used to filter out objects with pixel values
  >= ``peakmax``. (Default=None)

**Optimize alignment order:**

* ``enforce_user_order``: a boolean value indicating whether or not take the
  first image as a reference image and then align the rest of the images
  to that reference image in the order in which input images have been provided
  or to optimize order in which images are aligned. (Default=`False`)

**Reference Catalog parameters:**

* ``expand_refcat``: A boolean indicating whether or not to expand reference
  catalog with new sources from other input images that have been already
  aligned to the reference image. (Default=False)

**Object matching parameters:**

* ``minobj``: A positive `int` indicating minimum number of objects acceptable
  for matching. (Default=15)

* ``searchrad``: A `float` indicating the search radius in arcsec for a match.
  (Default=2.0)

* ``use2dhist``: A boolean indicating whether to use 2D histogram to find
  initial offset. (Default=True)

* ``separation``: Minimum object separation in arcsec. (Default=1.0)

* ``tolerance``: Matching tolerance for ``xyxymatch`` in arcsec. (Default=0.7)

* ``xoffset``: Initial guess for X offset in arcsec. (Default=0.0)

* ``yoffset``: Initial guess for Y offset in arcsec. (Default=0.0)

**Catalog fitting parameters:**

* ``fitgeometry``: A `str` value indicating the type of affine transformation
  to be considered when fitting catalogs. Allowed values:

  - ``'shift'``: x/y shifts only
  - ``'rshift'``: rotation and shifts
  - ``'rscale'``: rotation and scale
  - ``'general'``: shift, rotation, and scale

  The default value is "rshift".

  .. note::
      Mathematically, alignment of images observed in different tangent planes
      requires ``fitgeometry='general'`` in order to fit source catalogs
      in the different images even if mis-alignment is caused only by a shift
      or rotation in the tangent plane of one of the images.

      However, under certain circumstances, such as small alignment errors or
      minimal dithering during observations that keep tangent planes of the
      images to be aligned almost parallel, then it may be more robust to
      use a ``fitgeometry`` setting with fewer degrees of freedom such as
      ``'rshift'``, especially for "ill-conditioned" source catalogs such as
      catalogs with very few sources, or large errors in source positions, or
      sources placed along a line or bunched in a corner of the image (not
      spread across/covering the entire image).

* ``nclip``: A non-negative integer number of clipping iterations
  to use in the fit. (Default = 3)

* ``sigma``: A positive `float` indicating the clipping limit, in sigma units,
  used when performing fit. (Default=3.0)

**Astrometric fitting parameters:**

* ``align_to_gaia``: A boolean indicating whether or not to fit to
  perform the fit to an astrometric catalog. (Default=False)

* ``gaia_catalog``: String indicating what astrometric catalog should be used.
  Initially supported options: 'GAIADR2' and 'GAIADR1'. (Default='GAIADR2')

* ``min_gaia``: Minimum number of matches to astrometric sources to initiate a fit.
  (Default=5)

* ``save_gaia_catalog``: A boolean specifying whether or not to write out the
  astrometric catalog used for the fit as a separate product. (Default=False)
