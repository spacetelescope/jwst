===================
Available Pipelines
===================
There are many pre-defined pipeline modules for processing
data from different instrument observing modes through each of the 3 stages
of calibration. For all of the details see :ref:`pipelines`.

Pipeline/Step Suffix Definitions
================================

However the output file name is determined (:ref:`see above
<intro_output_file_discussion>`), the various stage 1, 2, and 3 pipeline modules
will use that file name, along with a set of predetermined suffixes, to compose
output file names. The output file name suffix will always replace any known
suffix of the input file name. Each pipeline module uses the appropriate suffix
for the product(s) it is creating. The list of suffixes is shown in the
following table. Replacement occurs only if the suffix is one known to the
calibration code. Otherwise, the new suffix will simply be appended to the
basename of the file.
