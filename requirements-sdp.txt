# To generate this file:
# The SDP-specific requirements
#
# This file is used for two purposes:
#    - Fix versions for an official DMS build
#    - Fix specific version numbers for compatibility reasons
#
# The default is there are normally no fixed versions.
# For an official DMS build, this file should be update using the
# commands below. After delivery of the final version for a DMS build,
# this file should be reverted to an empty state.
#
#     conda create -n sdp python -y
#     conda activate sdp
#     pip install -e .[test]
#     pip freeze | grep -v jwst.git >> requirements-sdp.txt
