Add a new ``adaptive_trace_model`` step to the spec2 and spec3 pipelines to create a model of the spectral trace.
Optionally, the trace model can be used to oversample the flux data, prior to resampling or cube building, to address undersampling effects.
Only IFU data is supported in the initial implementation.
