Implement a new EMIcorr algorithm that optimizes the phase and amplitude of
a reference waveform of known frequency. The best phase and amplitude are the
ones that, when applied to the waveform and subtracted from the data, produce
ramps for the pixels that are as linear as possible. Also, fix a minor bug in
the existing algorithm that prevented saving intermediate reference files.
