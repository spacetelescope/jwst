Add a new ``fit_profile`` step to the spec2 and spec3 pipelines to create spatial profiles for spectral data.
Optionally, the spatial profile can be used to oversample the flux data, prior to resampling or cube building, to address undersampling effects.
Only IFU data is supported in the initial implementation.
