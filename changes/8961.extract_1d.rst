Refactor the core extraction algorithm and aperture definition modules for slit and slitless extractions, for greater efficiency and maintainability. Extraction reference files in FITS format are no longer supported. Current behavior for extractions proceeding from extract1d reference files in JSON format is preserved, with minor improvements: DQ arrays are populated and error propagation is improved for some aperture types.
