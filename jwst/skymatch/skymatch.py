def match(images, skymethod='global+match', match_down=True, subtract=False):
    """
    A function to compute and/or "equalize" sky background in input images.

    .. note::
       Sky matching ("equalization") is possible only for **overlapping**
       images.

    Parameters
    ----------
    images : list of SkyImage or SkyGroup
        A list of of :py:class:`~jwst.skymatch.skyimage.SkyImage` or
        :py:class:`~jwst.skymatch.skyimage.SkyGroup` objects.

    skymethod : {'local', 'global+match', 'global', 'match'}, optional
        Select the algorithm for sky computation:

        * **'local'** : compute sky background values of each input image or
          group of images (members of the same "exposure"). A single sky value
          is computed for each group of images.

          .. note::
            This setting is recommended when regions of overlap between images
            are dominated by "pure" sky (as opposed to extended, diffuse
            sources).

        * **'global'** : compute a common sky value for all input images and
          groups of images. With this setting `match` will compute
          sky values for each input image/group, find the minimum sky value,
          and then it will set (and/or subtract) the sky value of each input image
          to this minimum value. This method *may* be
          useful when the input images have been already matched.

        * **'match'** : compute differences in sky values between images
          and/or groups in (pair-wise) common sky regions. In this case
          the computed sky values will be relative (delta) to the sky computed
          in one of the input images whose sky value will be set to
          (reported to be) 0. This setting will "equalize" sky values between
          the images in large mosaics. However, this method is not recommended
          when used in conjunction with
          `astrodrizzle <http://stsdas.stsci.edu/stsci_python_sphinxdocs_2.13/drizzlepac/astrodrizzle.html>`_
          because it computes relative sky values while `astrodrizzle` needs
          "absolute" sky values for median image generation and CR rejection.

        * **'global+match'** : first use the **'match'** method to
          equalize sky values between images and then find a minimum
          "global" sky value amongst all input images.

          .. note::
            This is the *recommended* setting for images
            containing diffuse sources (e.g., galaxies, nebulae)
            covering significant parts of the image.

    match_down : bool, optional
        Specifies whether the sky *differences* should be subtracted from
        images with higher sky values (`match_down` = `True`) to match the
        image with the lowest sky or sky differences should be added to the
        images with lower sky values to match the sky of the image with the
        highest sky value (`match_down` = `False`).

        .. note::
          This setting applies *only* when the `skymethod` parameter is
          either `'match'` or `'global+match'`.

    subtract : bool (Default = False)
        Subtract computed sky value from image data.


    Raises
    ------

    TypeError
        The `images` argument must be a Python list of
        :py:class:`~jwst.skymatch.skyimage.SkyImage` and/or
        :py:class:`~jwst.skymatch.skyimage.SkyGroup` objects.


    Notes
    -----

    :py:func:`match` provides new algorithms for sky value computations
    and enhances previously available algorithms used by, e.g.,
    `astrodrizzle <http://stsdas.stsci.edu/stsci_python_sphinxdocs_2.13/drizzlepac/astrodrizzle.html>`_.

    Two new methods of sky subtraction have been introduced (compared to the
    standard ``'local'``): ``'global'`` and ``'match'``, as well as a
    combination of the two -- ``'global+match'``.

    - The ``'global'`` method computes the minimum sky value across *all*
      input images and/or groups. That sky value is then considered to be
      the background in all input images.

    - The ``'match'`` algorithm is somewhat similar to the traditional sky
      subtraction method (`skymethod` = `'local'`) in the sense that it
      measures the sky independently in input images (or groups). The major
      differences are that, unlike the traditional method,

        #. ``'match'`` algorithm computes *relative* (delta) sky values with
           regard to the sky in a reference image chosen from the input list
           of images; *and*

        #. Sky statistics are computed only in the part of the image
           that intersects other images.

      This makes the ``'match'`` sky computation algorithm particularly useful
      for "equalizing" sky values in large mosaics in which one may have
      only (at least) pair-wise intersection of images without having
      a common intersection region (on the sky) in all images.

      The `'match'` method works in the following way: for each pair
      of intersecting images, an equation is written that
      requires that average surface brightness in the overlapping part of
      the sky be equal in both images. The final system of equations is then
      solved for unknown background levels.

      .. warning::

        The current algorithm is not capable of detecting cases where some subsets
        of intersecting images (from the input list of images) do not intersect
        at all with other subsets of intersecting images (except for the simple
        case when *single* images do not intersect any other images). In these
        cases the algorithm will find equalizing sky values for each
        intersecting subset of images and/or groups of images.
        However since these subsets of images do not intersect each other,
        sky will be matched only within each subset and the "inter-subset"
        sky mismatch could be significant.

        Users are responsible for detecting such cases and adjusting processing
        accordingly.

    - The ``'global+match'`` algorithm combines the ``'match'`` and
      ``'global'`` methods in order to overcome the limitation of the
      ``'match'`` method described in the note above: it uses the ``'global'``
      algorithm to find a baseline sky value common to all input images
      and the ``'match'`` algorithm to "equalize" sky values in the mosaic.
      Thus, the sky value of the "reference" image will be equal to the
      baseline sky value (instead of 0 in ``'match'`` algorithm alone).

    **Remarks:**
      * :py:func:`match` works directly on *geometrically distorted*
        flat-fielded images thus avoiding the need to perform distortion
        correction on the input images.

        Initially, the footprint of a chip in an image is approximated by a
        2D planar rectangle representing the borders of chip's distorted
        image. After applying distortion model to this rectangle and
        projecting it onto the celestial sphere, it is approximated by
        spherical polygons. Footprints of exposures and mosaics are
        computed as unions of such spherical polygons while overlaps
        of image pairs are found by intersecting these spherical polygons.

    **Limitations and Discussions:**
      Primary reason for introducing "sky match" algorithm was to try to
      equalize the sky in large mosaics in which computation of the
      "absolute" sky is difficult due to the presence of large diffuse
      sources in the image. As discussed above, :py:func:`match`
      accomplishes this by comparing "sky values" in a pair of images in the
      overlap region (that is common to both images). Quite obviously the
      quality of sky "matching" will depend on how well these "sky values"
      can be estimated. We use quotation marks around *sky values* because
      for some image "true" background may not be present at all and the
      measured sky may be the surface brightness of large galaxy, nebula, etc.

      In the discussion below we will refer to parameter names in
      :py:class:`~jwst.skymatch.skystatistics.SkyStats` and these
      parameter names may differ from the parameters of the actual `skystat`
      object passed to initializer of the
      :py:class:`~jwst.skymatch.skyimage.SkyImage`.

      Here is a brief list of possible limitations/factors that can affect
      the outcome of the matching (sky subtraction in general) algorithm:

      * Since sky subtraction is performed on *flat-fielded* but
        *not distortion corrected* images, it is important to keep in mind
        that flat-fielding is performed to obtain uniform surface brightness
        and not flux. This distinction is important for images that have
        not been distortion corrected. As a consequence, it is advisable that
        point-like sources be masked through the user-supplied mask files.
        Values different from zero in user-supplied masks indicate "good" data
        pixels. Alternatively, one can use `upper` parameter to limit the use
        of bright objects in sky computations.

      * Normally, distorted flat-fielded images contain cosmic rays. This
        algorithm does not perform CR cleaning. A possible way of minimizing
        the effect of the cosmic rays on sky computations is to use
        clipping (`nclip` > 0) and/or set `upper` parameter to a value
        larger than most of the sky background (or extended source) but
        lower than the values of most CR pixels.

      * In general, clipping is a good way of eliminating "bad" pixels:
        pixels affected by CR, hot/dead pixels, etc. However, for
        images with complicated backgrounds (extended galaxies, nebulae,
        etc.), affected by CR and noise, clipping process may mask different
        pixels in different images. If variations in the background are
        too strong, clipping may converge to different sky values in
        different images even when factoring in the "true" difference
        in the sky background between the two images.

      * In general images can have different "true" background values
        (we could measure it if images were not affected by large diffuse
        sources). However, arguments such as `lower` and `upper` will
        apply to all images regardless of the intrinsic differences
        in sky levels.
