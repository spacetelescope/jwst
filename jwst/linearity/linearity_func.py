    Short Summary
    -------------
    Apply linearity correction to individual groups in ramparr where dq
    has not been flagged as saturated in the saturation step with dq_flag.

    Scorr = Smeasured(1+A+B*Smeasured+C*Smeasured^2+D*Smeasured^3+...)

    Parameters
    ----------
    ramparr: 4D array containing ramp data

    dqarr: 4D array containing DQ information

    coeffarr: 3D array containing pixel-by-pixel linearity coefficient values
              for each term in the polynomial fit.

    dq_flag: Integer value representing the saturation flag value that was
             applied to dqarr by the saturation step
