        Create a new Drizzle output object and set the drizzle parameters.

        Parameters
        ----------

        product : str, optional
            A data model containing results from a previous run. The three
            extensions SCI, WHT, and CTX contain the combined image, total counts
            and image id bitmap, respectively. The WCS of the combined image is
            also read from the SCI extension.

        outwcs : `gwcs.WCS`
            The world coordinate system (WCS) of the resampled image.  If not
            provided, the WCS is taken from product.

        wt_scl : str, optional
            How each input image should be scaled. The choices are `exptime`,
            which scales each image by its exposure time, or `expsq`, which scales
            each image by the exposure time squared.  If not set, then each
            input image is scaled by its own weight map.

        pixfrac : float, optional
            The fraction of a pixel that the pixel flux is confined to. The
            default value of 1 has the pixel flux evenly spread across the image.
            A value of 0.5 confines it to half a pixel in the linear dimension,
            so the flux is confined to a quarter of the pixel area when the square
            kernel is used.

        kernel : str, optional
            The name of the kernel used to combine the inputs. The choice of
            kernel controls the distribution of flux over the kernel. The kernel
            names are: "square", "gaussian", "point", "tophat", "turbo", "lanczos2",
            and "lanczos3". The square kernel is the default.

        fillval : str, otional
            The value a pixel is set to in the output if the input image does
            not overlap it. The default value of INDEF does not set a value.

        this method after doing its setup.

        Parameters
        ----------

        insci : array
            A 2d numpy array containing the input image to be drizzled.
            it is an error to not supply an image.

        inwcs : wcs
            The world coordinate system of the input image. This is
            used to convert the pixels to the output coordinate system.

        inwht : array, optional
            A 2d numpy array containing the pixel by pixel weighting.
            Must have the same dimenstions as insci. If none is supplied,
            the weghting is set to one.

        xmin : float, optional
            This and the following three parameters set a bounding rectangle
            on the output image. Only pixels on the output image inside this
            rectangle will have their flux updated. Xmin sets the minimum value
            of the x dimension. The x dimension is the dimension that varies
            quickest on the image. If the value is zero or less, no minimum will
            be set in the x dimension. All four parameters are zero based,
            counting starts at zero.

        xmax : float, optional
            Sets the maximum value of the x dimension on the bounding box
            of the ouput image. If the value is zero or less, no maximum will
            be set in the x dimension.

        ymin : float, optional
            Sets the minimum value in the y dimension on the bounding box. The
            y dimension varies less rapidly than the x and represents the line
            index on the output image. If the value is zero or less, no minimum
            will be set in the y dimension.

        ymax : float, optional
            Sets the maximum value in the y dimension. If the value is zero or
            less, no maximum will be set in the y dimension.

        expin : float, optional
            The exposure time of the input image, a positive number. The
            exposure time is used to scale the image if the units are counts and
            to scale the image weighting if the drizzle was initialized with
            wt_scl equal to "exptime" or "expsq."

        in_units : str, optional
            The units of the input image. The units can either be "counts"
            or "cps" (counts per second.) If the value is counts, before using
            the input image it is scaled by dividing it by the exposure time.

        wt_scl : float, optional
            If drizzle was initialized with wt_scl left blank, this value will
            set a scaling factor for the pixel weighting. If drizzle was
            initialized with wt_scl set to "exptime" or "expsq", the exposure time
            will be used to set the weight scaling and the value of this parameter
            will be ignored.

    Low level routine for performing 'drizzle' operation on one image.

    Parameters
    ----------

    insci : 2d array
        A 2d numpy array containing the input image to be drizzled.

    input_wcs : gwcs.WCS object
        The world coordinate system of the input image.

    inwht : 2d array
        A 2d numpy array containing the pixel by pixel weighting.
        Must have the same dimensions as insci. If none is supplied,
        the weghting is set to one.

    output_wcs : gwcs.WCS object
        The world coordinate system of the output image.

    outsci : 2d array
        A 2d numpy array containing the output image produced by
        drizzling. On the first call it should be set to zero.
        Subsequent calls it will hold the intermediate results

    outwht : 2d array
        A 2d numpy array containing the output counts. On the first
        call it should be set to zero. On subsequent calls it will
        hold the intermediate results.

    outcon : 2d or 3d array, optional
        A 2d or 3d numpy array holding a bitmap of which image was an input
        for each output pixel. Should be integer zero on first call.
        Subsequent calls hold intermediate results.

    expin : float
        The exposure time of the input image, a positive number. The
        exposure time is used to scale the image if the units are counts.

    in_units : str
        The units of the input image. The units can either be "counts"
        or "cps" (counts per second.)

    wt_scl : float
        A scaling factor applied to the pixel by pixel weighting.

    uniqid : int, optional
        The id number of the input image. Should be one the first time
        this function is called and incremented by one on each subsequent
        call.

    xmin : float, optional
        This and the following three parameters set a bounding rectangle
        on the input image. Only pixels on the input image inside this
        rectangle will have their flux added to the output image. Xmin
        sets the minimum value of the x dimension. The x dimension is the
        dimension that varies quickest on the image. If the value is zero,
        no minimum will be set in the x dimension. All four parameters are
        zero based, counting starts at zero.

    xmax : float, optional
        Sets the maximum value of the x dimension on the bounding box
        of the input image. If the value is zero, no maximum will
        be set in the x dimension, the full x dimension of the output
        image is the bounding box.

    ymin : float, optional
        Sets the minimum value in the y dimension on the bounding box. The
        y dimension varies less rapidly than the x and represents the line
        index on the input image. If the value is zero, no minimum  will be
        set in the y dimension.

    ymax : float, optional
        Sets the maximum value in the y dimension. If the value is zero, no
        maximum will be set in the y dimension,  the full x dimension
        of the output image is the bounding box.

    pixfrac : float, optional
        The fraction of a pixel that the pixel flux is confined to. The
        default value of 1 has the pixel flux evenly spread across the image.
        A value of 0.5 confines it to half a pixel in the linear dimension,
        so the flux is confined to a quarter of the pixel area when the square
        kernel is used.

    kernel: str, optional
        The name of the kernel used to combine the input. The choice of
        kernel controls the distribution of flux over the kernel. The kernel
        names are: "square", "gaussian", "point", "tophat", "turbo", "lanczos2",
        and "lanczos3". The square kernel is the default.

    fillval: str, optional
        The value a pixel is set to in the output if the input image does
        not overlap it. The default value of INDEF does not set a value.

    Returns
    -------
    A tuple with three values: a version string, the number of pixels
    on the input image that do not overlap the output image, and the
    number of complete lines on the input image that do not overlap the
    output input image.
