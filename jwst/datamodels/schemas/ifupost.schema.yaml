title: Nirspec IFUPOST reference file model
definitions:
  slice_transforms:
    type: object
    description: |
      The Nirspec IFUPOST transform for one slice.
    properties:
      linear:
        type: object
        description: |
          The linear part of the transform per slice.
          It has an analytical inverse.
          An instance of astropy.modeling.Model.
      xpoly:
        type: object
        description: |
          The forward polynomial in X.
          The backward polynomial should be assigned when creating the model.
          An instance of astropy.modeling.Model.
      xpoly_distortion:
        type: object
        description: |
          The wavelength dependent distortion polynomial in X.
          The backward polynomial is assigned as inverse.
          An instance of astropy.modeling.Model.
      ypoly:
        type: object
        description: |
          The forward polynomial in Y.
          The backward polynomial should be assigned when creating the model.
