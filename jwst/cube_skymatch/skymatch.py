def match(skycubes, subtract=False):
    """
    A function to compute and/or "equalize" sky background in input cubes.

    .. note::
        Sky matching ("equalization") is possible only for **overlapping**
        cubes.

    .. note::
        This function may modify input `SkyCube` objects. Make a copy of the
        input objects if their preservation is important.


    Parameters
    ----------
    skycubes : list of SkyCubes
        A list of of :py:class:`SkyCube` objects whose sky needs to be
        matched.

    subtract : bool, optional
        Indicates whether to subtract computed sky differences from cube data.


    Returns
    -------

    out_skycubes : list of SkyCube
        A list of `SkyCube` each containing sky background polynomial
        coefficients and, if requested, background-subtracted data.

        .. note::
            Output list is not in the same order as input list but rather it
            follows the order in which cubes have been matched with the first
            cube being a "reference" cube.

    nsubspace : int
        Number of subspaces. A value larger than one indicates that not all
        images overlap.
