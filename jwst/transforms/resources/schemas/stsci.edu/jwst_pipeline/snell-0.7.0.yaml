  NIRSpec transforms through the prism.

description: |
  This model does all transforms through the NIRSpec prism:
  - computes the refraction index as a function of lambda.
  - Applies Snell's law through front surface.
  - Rotates to back surface.
  - Applies reflection from back surface.
  - Rotates to front surface
  - Applies Snell's law through front surface.
