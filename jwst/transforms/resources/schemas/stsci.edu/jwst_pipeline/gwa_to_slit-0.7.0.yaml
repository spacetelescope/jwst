  NIRSPEC set of models from GWA to slit_frame.

description: |
  This model is used by the NIRSPEC WCS pipeline.
  It maps slit to the transform from the Grating Wheel Assembly (GWA)
  to the coordinate frame of the slit, where (0, 0) is the center of
  the slit.

          An array with slit numbers.
          The slit number is computed from the quadrant and
          the slit ID in this quadrant using
