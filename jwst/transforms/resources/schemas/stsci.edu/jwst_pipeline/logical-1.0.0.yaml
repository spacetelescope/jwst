title: >
  A model performing logical operations on arrays.

examples:
  -
    - If the input is less that 10, set its value to NaN.

    - |
        !<tag:stsci.edu:jwst_pipeline/logical-1.0.0>
          compareto: 10
          condition: LT
          value: .nan
  -
    - |
        If the input is less that [1,2,3,4], set its value to [5,6,7,8].
        The input array should have the same shape.

    - |
        !<tag:stsci.edu:jwst_pipeline/logical-1.0.0>
          compareto: [1 ,2, 3, 4]
          condition: LT
          value: [5, 6, 7, 8]
