  A sequence of 3D rotations.

description: |
  A sequence of 3D rotations around different axes.
  This represents JWST transform from the telescope
  coordinate system (V2,V3) to ICRS.

examples:
  -
    - JWST V2, V3 to sky transform.

      axes_order:
        description: |
          A sequence of "x", "y" or "z" characters representing an axis of rotation.
          The number of characters must equal the number of angles.
          For the JWST V23 to sky transform the axes are zyxyz.
