title: >
  Convert coordinates between vector and directional cosine form.

description: |
  This schema is for representing any model that takes coordinates and does
  some computation with them. Models have no parameters. Currently it supports
  DirCos2Unitless, Unitless2DirCos.

examples:
  -
    - Convert directional cosines to vectors.

    - |

        !<tag:stsci.edu:jwst_pipeline/coords-0.7.0>
          model_type: directional2unitless

  -
    - Convert vectors to directional cosines.

    - |
        !<tag:stsci.edu:jwst_pipeline/coords-0.7.0>
          model_type: unitless2directional
