#! /usr/bin/env python
# Author: Dave Grumm
# Program: compare_cr_navg_files.py
# Purpose: routine to compare locations of created crs to detected crs
# History: 11/23/10 - first version, base on compare_cr_files.py, but here navg is a required command line argument
#
# Required Input:
#   'created_file':  file of generated GCR/SPs that was output by mc_single_2d or mc_3d
#   'found_file':  file of detected GCR/SPs that was generated by ramp_fit or ramp_fit_arr
#   'sim_file' : file containing a simulated (2d) image which was the input to create_cube
#   'slope_file' : file of calculated slope averages that was calculated and output by ramp_fit or ramp_fit_arr
#   'navg': number of reads that are averaged over
#
# Optional Input:
#  'verb': level of verbosity for print statements; verb=2 is extremely verbose, verb=1 is moderate,
#           verb=0 is minimal; default = 0
#
# Arrays output to files:
#  'f_only.fits': 2d array of pixels that were found but not created
#  'c_only.fits': 2d array of pixels that were created but not found
#  'neither.fits: 2d array of pixels that were neither created nor found
#  'both.fits': 2d array of pixels that were both created and found
#  'c_navg.fits': data cube of averaged values of pixels with created CRs
#
# Usage from linux command line:
# ./compare_cr_files.py cr_and_sp.fits foundcr.fits test_sim_30.fits fslopes.fits 4
#   ... where the file of the created CRs (created_file) = 'cr_and_sp.fits',
#   the file of the detected CRs (found_file) = 'foundcr.fits',
#   the sample image file (sim_file) = 'test_sim_30.fits',
#   the calculated count rate file (slope_file) = 'fslopes.fits',
#   the number of reads averaged over = 4
#
# Usage within pyraf :
# --> a1 = compare_cr_navg_files.compare_cr_navg_files("cr_and_sp.fits","foundcr.fits","sim_2k_30.fits","fslopes.fits",4)
# --> status = a1.compare()
#
# pragma: no cover
